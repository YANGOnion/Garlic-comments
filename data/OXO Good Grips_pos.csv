0,Easy to use and clean.  I've had a few different presses over the years but this one seems to be the best of all the past presses.  The basket for putting the cloves in is huge and more of the garlic is actually pushed through the grate vs. other presses which force lots of the garlic around the sides of the press rather than through the grate.  Dislodging pressed remnants is easy with the cleaning tool built right into the press.  The hinge is robust and I can see this lasting for years.  I use this almost every day because it's so easy to clean.,4.0
1,"This is incredibly sturdy and effective.  I can put in multiple whole unpeeled cloves and this thing still works great.  It saves a lot of time.  Also, the bumps for pushing out the peels help with cleaning.  Anything I don't get, the dishwasher does!",5.0
2,"I usually mince my garlic by knife but every once in a while the garlic should be pressed. I got this for my brother, whom I'm visiting, and I'd forgotten how good it is - and especially how easy it is to clean!  I have one at home and will start using it again.",5.0
3,"So far works well. Purchase for my Mom who has weakened wrists/hands with arthritis, and she says it works much better than her old one. Has a nicer heavier feel to it which makes it seem more sturdy.",4.0
4,This garlic press is great! it makes cooking with garlic SO much easier. The garlic can be inserted in the press with the skin and out comes small prices of garlic with no skin! After using this tool in the kitchen I would never want to back to manually mincing the garlic my hand.,5.0
5,"This is the easiest to use garlic mincer that I've owned. It was worth the extra money. I have bad tendinitis in my dominant wrist, and this is the only garlic mincer that I can use with it.",5.0
6,I got rid of my Pampered Chef press after I used this one the first time.  I use it weekly and is the easiest to clean.  It's the only one I will ever need.,5.0
7,Been wanting to get one for a while my mother in law as a different one and it makes cooking so much faster especially since I use garlic in like everything! Hers doesn't have the side that helps push the skin out of the holes and her holes are smaller. I wanted to get one that had that so i didn't struggle to remove the the skin. Used it once so far but it works great!,5.0
8,"Fresh garlic tastes so much better than powdered garlic. And so much healthier for you. Garlic press works great, has high quality design and easy to cleanup.",5.0
9,OXO never disappoints and this garlic press is no exception. I've tried many different presses and I like this one the best.,5.0
10,"This is excellent.  It has a good feel in the hand, and the design cleans the crushed garlic bits very successfully.",5.0
11,Love this garlic press!  Easy to clean and can be put in the dishwasher!  Wish I had purchased it sooner!,5.0
12,"I've been using a garlic press for years, and my old one finally gave out. I purchased this one because I've had good luck with OXO in the past. They did not disappoint. I liked the weight of the press, and it was actually a bit easier to squeeze than my old one. The built in cleaner is a very nice touch.  On my old press it was a separate tool that I was always losing, so I really like that this one is attached. It cleans up easily, and is easy to use.",5.0
13,Makes mincing garlic a whole lot easier. Aside from this i have no problem cleaning it. Good buy.,5.0
14,"The design of this device makes it the best press available, including the Rowav.",5.0
15,Works well.  Sturdy and I love the self cleaning feature.  Easy to use with arthritis.,5.0
16,"This has worked flawlessly for us so far, and makes using garlic in recipes even easier.",5.0
17,"Comparing this to a cheap all-plastic press bought at the supermarket, this press blows it out of the water. One good squeeze and the garlic comes out.<br /><br />There will be a layer of garlic left in the press, if that bothers you then crush and chop your garlic with a knife. If the crushed garlic is stuck on the press, then just use a knife to scrape it off.",5.0
18,"Nice, solid construction, and works perfect. Very happy and would recommend.",5.0
19,"This is a fanatic garlic press. The best one I have ever used. In general, I love OXO products",5.0
20,"Never had one before, works great",5.0
21,Definitely better than chopping by hand.,4.0
22,Best garlic press I've ever found.,5.0
23,Great product. Fantastic quality,5.0
24,Works great.  Cleans up well.,5.0
25,"Chunky, well made, work well",5.0
26,This garlic press works great! It has a soft grip that makes pressing the garlic very easy and pain free. You simply place the garlic clove in the press and squeeze the handles. You can also rotate the handles completely around to remove some of the excess garlic from inside of the press. This product is also extremely easy to clean and is small enough that it fits nicely into a kitchen drawer.,5.0
27,great and easy to clean,5.0
28,Easy to use. Easy to clean.,5.0
29,"This is my second Oxo garlic press. I use a lot of garlic, and my other one would be in the dishwasher right when I needed it. This brand is easy to squeeze and easy to clean. Love it!",5.0
30,"This is probably the third garlic press I've had in the last five years and I'm really impressed by it. I no longer put garlic presses in the dishwasher due to issues with the previous (different brand) ones, but it's really easy to clean. I love the grip and weight, and overall love the quality.",5.0
31,"I bought this because it had a built-it notches that pushes out the excess garlic. It works great, although it is heavier than my last one. I wish the built in notches were a bit longer. Overall, it has a very nice grip that may have rub marks if not cleaned after every use.",4.0
32,Works great! The grips are huge and the weight of the product is awesome.<br />Saves so much time. You still have to de-skin the cloves but that's life.<br />I do think the drawback here is that it won't get the job done with smaller cloves. Go big or go home with these.,5.0
33,"As usual, OXO delivers a high quality product at an affordable price.",5.0
34,Very good purchase for the money!,4.0
35,Excellent garlic press- easy to use and easy to clean!,5.0
36,OK,4.0
37,Great love it use it all the time,5.0
38,Leave the skins on.  This is a sturdy garlic press that can handle the job.,5.0
39,"Hands down, this is the best garlic press I've had. The solid metal construction doesn't deform when in use, and the silicone cleaning piece is a lifesaver - one quick rinse and it's ready to go back in the drawer. I would highly recommend this as one of the few unitaskers in anyone's kitchen.",5.0
40,"Nice garlic press, very easy to use, pretty easy to clean - far easier in both respects than some of the higher rated garlic presses on Amazon. I had one these for about 8 years and it started failing, eventually the hinge snapped - so this is number 2. The design is every so slightly different, hopefully this one will last even longer.",4.0
41,Really good stuff,5.0
42,Took a while to choose a garlic press! Oh how terrible my life is! I'm glad I purchased this one. It's very strong and sturdy. Rubber grips are very much in tact and don't see them being destroyed anytime soon. Worked great with garlic with the peel still on and ginger root too! Nice quality and made to last.,5.0
43,Perfect product,5.0
44,"This is a big improvement over my previous OXO garlic press (which will be recycled via Salvation Army since it's still in nice condition).  This updated version has attractive lines, is very comfortable to work with, and has a much larger chamber.  It appears the self-cleaning feature has been improved upon too.  OXO products have served me well over the years, and I expect this item will be no exception.",5.0
45,We had a garlic press that I purchased from another company...&#34;Pampered..you know who.&#34; That one broke. Blessing in disguise. This is SO much better. Very well made and no elements to lose. It has a built-in &#34;cleaner&#34; to push out the garlic pieces that are left behind. High quality and priced well. I think this will last much longer than our last press.,5.0
46,"My only complaint is that my first one broke.  But it did see about 8 years of regular wear.  So I bought another.  Good price, nice and heavy.  Easy to clean.  When this one breaks, I suspect I'll buy it a third time.",4.0
47,Great quality- works better than expected,5.0
48,"Easy to clean and sturdy, good option.",4.0
49,I think this is the best garlic press on the market,5.0
50,Heavy duty amd the little cleaner pins are awesone.  I can mince a whole head of garlic cloves in seconds.  Cleans up easy too.,5.0
51,"Best garlic press we found.  Presses garlic perfectly (don't try to press more than one clove at a time).  Best of all, it cleans easily.",5.0
52,"It works good, but leaves quite a bit of garlic left over.",4.0
53,"Great garlic press, no complaints.",5.0
54,I'm picky about presses!  This one is comfortable in the grip and the garlic area and holes are a tad bigger than the norm which I prefer - perfect size - easy cleaning.,5.0
55,Great item,5.0
56,Excellent product.,5.0
57,I've owned this product for years and have taken it for granted until I used a friends garlic press. This press if comfortable and just works. Nearly all the garlic comes out and none of it spills over the sides.,5.0
58,"Best garlic press ever! The design feature that allows you to flip it around and knock out the rind is key. Also, this garlic press doesn't require a grip of steel to use. I love mine so much that I bought one for my 82 year old mother while visiting her.",5.0
59,"I always just wacked the garlic with my knife, but I wanted to try one of these. I believe this OXO garlic press works as it should. I like it a lot and recommend it. I don't know if I'll stop wacking my garlic, but in the mean time I'll just continue to use this gadget.",5.0
60,"Very nice garlic press. It's the best one I've ever used. I just wish the red side was a little bit longer for pushing out the post pressed stuff. But it's still a nice, solid garlic press.",4.0
61,Great quality!,5.0
62,"This is a very efficient,very comfortable to use and very easy to clean garlic press.It replaces a very old French press which although of great<br />sentimental value was not efficient,not comfortable to use and not easy to clean!",5.0
63,"Made tough, feels heavy and sturdy, and the chamber has plenty of room. The red cleaner really helps with the stuff caught inside, and it's safe in the wash too. Last one I had broke after 3 uses, but future archaeologists will probably find this one quite in tact thousands of years from now. Love it!",5.0
64,I had a garlic press that I was using for years and it broke. I bought this one to replace it and am very pleased with my purchase. This press is heavy and sturdy making it easy to press the garlic. It seems like it will last me a few years.,5.0
65,"Really love it. It's expensive but it's worth it. You can tell it's a durable product that'll last forever.<br />This is how I use it. I add 2-3 peeled garlic cloves. I'm really weak so I have to use all my strength to squeeze the minced garlic out. There will be smushed/dried out garlic inside. I keep adding more cloves and squeezing it out until I'm done. Once all the garlic is minced, I'll use a knife or fork to move around the squished garlic inside and then I'll squeeze it out again.<br />Cleaning: I soak it under water with the rest of the dishes and then use either a brush or add it to the dishwasher instead.<br /><br />I love garlic and I hate mincing it, so I'm very happy with this product.",5.0
66,works well and easy to clean,5.0
67,"I love this tool, I don't know how I lived so long without it, I never want to hand chop garlic again. Works great and is easy to clean, what more could you need.",5.0
68,Has nice weight to it. Feels like it was well built. Handles are comfortable and it's very easy to use. You have to squeeze the garlic through the steel grate but it's really not hard to do.,5.0
69,Great item for the kitchen. Comfortable handle. Easily crushes the garlic.,5.0
70,cannot live without this amazing garlic press. Is it sad to say it's life changing?!,5.0
71,Excellent purchase. Heavy duty. Easy to use. High quality.,5.0
72,Works good - One of the reason I picked this over the others is the hand is made from a rub/plastic material which is easier to hold vs the all metal ones.,5.0
73,This garlic press is a life-saver! In no time it's crushed and ready for cooking! Love it and have recommended it to all my friends! It's sooo easy to clean as well!,4.0
74,All good,5.0
75,"This is easy to use but maybe a bit heavy yet that makes it sturdy.  I like not having a separate tool to track down to push out the smushed up garlic. We're garlic eaters so this gets used a lot and put through the dishwasher with no problems, though it would be just as easy to hand wash it.",5.0
76,"I giggled as I ordered this for my husband for his birthday, thinking he would think it was a silly gift,  but he loved it......and has been using it several times a week since.  I made out in that deal.",5.0
77,I bought this garlic press because of the reviews and also because my last one was made out of two pieces (for cleaning purposes) and one piece got lost. U can put two garlic at a time and it is easy to press. Very happy,5.0

79,Works great!,5.0

82,"Easy to press, easy to clean.",5.0

84,"NO MORE GARLIC HANDS!!!!! This press is made well, quality materials, works wonderfully. Love it. No more chopping garlic by hand, just peel and press! Super easy to clean too, love this thing!!",5.0
85,Oxo just makes the best kitchen tools. You can't go wrong if Oxo is on it. I use this when I am too lazy to chop garlic and it works great.,5.0

93,"I received the item as stated.  I purchased the same item from a retail store about 5 years ago.  I am replacing because, I broke the crusher due the garlic pieces being large and to many pieces in the crusher.",4.0

95,Sturdy presser!,5.0
96,"I really like it, almost love it, but there's no slicing option, like there was on our old one.  Just a crush.  The crush, however, is great - and it's pretty easy to clean.",4.0
97,This is an awesome product and works extremely well. My only complaint is that it is not that easy to clean.,4.0
98,This thing is great.  Easy clean up - just put it in dishwasher.  A good workout for your arms.  Lots of minced garlic in a short time.,5.0

226,"I have loved the OXO brand since my first purchase of an OXO product almost 10 years ago.  I have since replaced pretty much every kitchen gadget I own with the OXO Brand.  This garlic press is truly the &#34;Cadillac&#34; of garlic presses.  It is heavy (almost a pound) because it is made out of real metal.  It is tough and put together to last (unlike the bargain ones that last about 3 presses until they don't line up right anymore!) This thing presses garlic like a dream... and presses the whole clove!  You will rarely have issues where part of the clove doesn't get pressed because of misalignment issues, etc.  As for cleaning... flip the handle around and the little pad pushes all of the remnants out of the holes... rinse with hot water and air dry.  I can't imagine ever going back to the bargain brands again... and I won't have to.  I believe this garlic press will outlive me.",5.0

271,"My husband was obsessed with the idea of getting a good garlic press.  And after much research (including earlier OXO versions of this garlic press), he came to the conclusion that this was the best one for us.  I have to say, it is honestly the best garlic press I have used in my life.  I also think its one of the most functional kitchen tools I've used in a long time that does precisely what I'd hoped it would do -- at a high quality -- and easily.",5.0
272,"I eat garlic, a lot. The self-cleaning feature is quick and convenient - it works. This baby is heavy and durable - much less hand pressure is required compared to other presses. The garlic chamber is large and can hold 2-3 large cloves.<br />Important note to discerning cooks: the holes on this press are a bit larger than standard.<br />The garlic will not come out finely crushed but rather a chunky crush.<br />If you want ultra fine crushed garlic you will need to do a few seconds of dicing to get it to your desired consistency.<br />Otherwise,",5.0
273,"I needed 2 presses....one for home and one for work. Not wanting to spend $30.00 on them, I bought this OXO and a $5.00 cheaper kitchenaide. The OXO is the absolute best I have ever used. The KitchenAid was a piece of garbage and a large waste of money. I ended up buying a second OXO! You can stuff it full of garlic and it presses relatively easily and it's ridiculously easy to clean. Hands down the best design and the Best Buy! This coming from a professional chef of 35 years.",5.0
274,"STOP LOOKING FOR A GARLIC PRESS. You have found the best of the best. Ask me, I know. I am old and have used garlic presses before.<br /> I read all the reviews for all the presses here on Amazon and Google and consumer reports. I decided on this one, to replace my pampered chef one (which I never was thrilled about and then it bent out of shape and I struggled with it for a year and finally gave up)<br /><br />I bought this Good grip, and I bought one for my son (who had a sorry garlic press with a swinging basket: piece of crap.) I love, love, love this press. My son used his Good Grip just a few days ago, he tells me  &#34;how much he loves his press. He never knew that a good garlic press would be worth using&#34;.<br />No waste of garlic with this press. Easy, really easy to clean.<br />My co-worker just asked me if I knew where to get a garlic press, she had never owned one and she is in her 70's. I said &#34;you asked the right person&#34; and told her all about my garlic press and offered to make a purchase for her on Amazon. Which I did buy her one, (she is paying for it, I just used my account).<br />Only problem, They raised the price of the press from 11.99 to 15.98. Shame on you folks raising the price right before Christmas. Anyway, I know she will love it. It is very easy to use, with the cushioned grip and the ease with pressing the garlic. That is what I enjoy most, I use to struggle with the other press that I had, it took all my strength and then some to press one garlic clove. No more struggle, beautiful design easy clean.<br /><br />Stop looking for a good press and buy this one.",5.0
275,"SOOOOO Much easier than dicing garlich with a knife... and saves your fingers from that lingering strong garlic-y smell as well.  A little bit of a pain to clean, so may not be worth it for only 1 or 2 cloves, but any more than that and it's definitely worth the time!",5.0
276,"I've broken several garlic presses over the years and struggled to find one that could press efficiently without shattering under the force.  This design is the best I've ever used!  So much force can be exerted with this design, zero flex in the handle, and it self-cleans (more or less) - no rust-prone basket to kick out and clean, etc.<br /><br />If it ever breaks, it'll be right back on my doorstep a couple days later!",5.0

288,"Prior to my purchase I read the  reviews for a bunch of mincers.  All of them had some drawbacks, including this one, which some people said had a weak hinge that broke on them.  I was nervous about buying this model because it was more costly than many other models, and I feared it would break at the hinge too.<br /><br />Last night I spent 2 hours mincing a huge pile of garlic cloves, some both completely peeled and some with a bit of skin around them.  I'm happy to say that this held up like a champ, and even squeezed the garlic out of the ones with the skin.  I had zero problems and the large handles gave me plenty of torque.  Moreover, it cleaned up super easy, with most of the work being done by simply running it under hot water.<br /><br />So long story, short, I like this product and heartily recommend it.",5.0
289,"This is a great garlic press. Since the holes are big, it doesn't require  much pressure to press; however, it works great with peeled garlic only. You need to clean and dry it right away after use or else you will get kind of mold looking inside the press.",4.0
290,"My husband and I used the &#34;minced garlic in oil&#34; for cooking before, it just tasted different compared to the fresh garlic, so we decided to buy a good garlic press. We like OXO brand, usually they have good quality and creative products. When we received the product, we were glad we bought it! It's comfortable to press with good material structure, and dishwasher safe!",5.0
291,"I cannot live without a garlic press in my kitchen and I've gone through (accidentally broken) several. This one is great so far. The self - cleaning nubs work beautifully. The only thing I don't like is that if I throw it in the dishwasher or let it soak too long, it will collect water in-between the plastic handles and the metal part. If you hand wash it, this won't be an issue.",5.0
292,"This arrived with one of the cleaning &#34;fingers&#34; broken off so one hole isn't pressed out when you flip it backwards.  Still works and if I press enough garlic through it the rest of the fingers will take up the slack and everything pops back out.  Much better quality than I can find at the local Wal-Mart,  Just make sure to clean the thing after using and not let it sit around.  Would be 5 stars if it didn't arrive damaged, but not bad enough to bother sending it back.",4.0
293,This item works well at pressing the garlic. I have recently opted to using this item when a recipe calls for minced onions. I like the red rubber pad that pushes the remnants of the skin out after having pressed the garlic through the holes. The rubber on the handles seem well made as I've washed it several times and it had held quite well. I can see having this item in my kitchen essentials for years to come.,5.0
294,"This is a good heavy piece of equipment, what you would expect from this company. I wish the prongs were a little bit longer for cleaning, but it gets the job done. The well itself is deep and can hold several medium sized cloves of garlic. This is something I find I need two hands to use because it's so large and sturdy. I am not sure how well it would work if someone had arthritis. I use it just about every day. I feel like it will last me a long time.",4.0
295,"This is an excellent press! I'll never go back to mincing garlic with a knife if I can help it. It's heavy and feels very well made, with no loose parts. The soft rubber on the handles makes squeezing large amounts of garlic painless, and the rubber pad for cleaning the press works really well and gets all of the garlic out. I use a paring knife to scrape the garlic off the press, then flip it around and use the rubber pad and a knife to get the last bits out. Just be sure to rinse it well afterwards and it will stay clean.",5.0
296,"I bought this to replace an old Pampered Chef garlic press that the finish was wearing off of. I couldn't be happier! In my opinion, the OXO is much nicer. This press is large but I can still crush a single clove of garlic without wasting any. The cleaning tool works great! I love that it is built in to the handle. I can put it through the dishwasher and it comes out clean every time. I don't think you can go wrong with OXO.",5.0
297,"I've tried a lot of different garlic presses and most of them are hard to press and a mess to clean.  This is the easiest to squeeze with the soft rubber around the handles and has a big opening for the garlic to go into.  Yes, it's much easier to clean by comparison, but you'll still need to work some of the garlic out by hand.",4.0
298,"This is the first time I'm using a garlic press as I was apprehensive of several issues one could have. If the quality of the metal is not good enough, it may rub into the garlic and hence enter through the cooked food. It may not be able to press the garlic hard enough to get a finely grated garlic. Or it may break if I press it too hard, and too early.<br /><br />This product took care of all my concerns and it was easy to use. Just by the looks of it, one can tell OXO has done a good job with this one as well. I have several other OXO products in my kitchen and I love their quality.<br /><br />I was able to press more than one garlic pods and that came out fine. Although a thin layer of peel is left behind, but that isnt' too much of  a problem.<br /><br />There is absolutely no issue of garlic sticking back as the red colored built-in cleaner pushes all  of the garlic out.<br /><br />A point to take note of is that due to the strong smell of garlic, I tend to throw it on the top shelf of the dishwasher instead of hand washing, fearing the smell may not go away.<br />I've been using it for almost 2 months now and continue to love using it everyday.",99
299,"This is a great garlic press. I especially like that the cleaner thing is attached to the handle so you just flip it around and Voila! All the other ones I've had with removable cleaners got lost in the drawer, never to be seen again. Oh yeah, it also does a fine job of squishing garlic.",5.0
300,"Such a fantastic garlic press. Gets whole cloves with minimal waste ( a little is left over, can be folded and condensed for a little second-press action.) Easy breezy to clean. Solidly built. A little bulky in the drawer, but its size is also a plus for crushing big cloves and knowing it'll last a lifetime. 10/10.",5.0
301,This is the first garlic press I've ever owned and it makes me wish I had purchased one years ago. This makes adding a little garlic to any recipe quick and easy. It's like something out of Harry Potter. You literally put a clove in the press and squeeze. Magic. It's easy to use and easy to clean because it goes right in the dishwasher. I'm not super strong (opening jars often takes a few attempts) but I was able to use this easily and the handle doesn't hurt my hand. Highly recommended.,99
302,"I had a garlic press that was made out of cast metal in the past, it worked well but one day on a particularly hard clove the handle snapped off.  Next time I was at the store I looked for a replacement but nothing there felt particularly sturdy, at least not sturdier than the press I had been using.  Since then I've been buying the little jars of pre-minced garlic, which has worked fine and is convenient, but I always worry I'm losing out on freshness.<br /><br />I saw this garlic press come up on my feed, and having had great luck with OXO products in the past, I decided to give it a try.  I'm happy to say, it's darn near perfect.  There's no brittle feeling to the metal, the hinge is nice and thick (but also has a little bit of play, which is a good thing, it won't bind up).  The rubber handles are nice and grippy, even when a little wet, and the plastic nubs help you get every last piece of garlic by clearing the holes in the press when you reverse it.  I can go back to buying fresh garlic without the hassle and stop buying the jars so often.",5.0
303,Best garlic press ever! My old one bit the dust so ordered this one. It does have a deep well for bigger pieces of garlic and easy clean up.,5.0
304,"Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received an OXO Good Grips Garlic Press for review. What a solid piece of metal! This is easily the most robustly-constructed garlic press I have ever used. There is absolutely no wobbling at the hinge, and the metal casting is done perfectly and there is only a really tiny gap between the pressing surface and the grille. This is very important because in practice this means you get almost all your garlic back instead of having a lot of lumps trapped in the gap. The handle is wrapped in the typical OXO grade of soft rubber and is definitely not going to slip. OXO's design in this garlic press is also pretty smart: if you turn the press in the opposite direction, you will be pressing a plastic with many pokes through the holds in the grille. This effectively cleans the holes and in practice all that's left is a quick rinse. I have no hesitation recommending this garlic press from OXO. 5/5.",99
305,"The day after I got the OXO Good Grips Garlic Press, I put my old presses - all three of them - in a bag to take to the Good Will store.  None of them worked very well, but OXO's is an absolute dream. It's perfect, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />The handles are ergonomic, big and soft, easy on the hands.  The chamber holds two big cloves and you don't even have to peel them. I cut the ends off and put them in and squeezed.  Then I flipped the press, removed the peels and had perfect garlic. It's simple and easy and you don't end up with Garlic Fingers for the next 24 hours.<br /><br />A cleaning device is built in and it works perfectly, leaving no garlic schmutz to dry onto the little holes.  You can also pop this guy into the top shelf of the dishwasher if you want.<br /><br />This press is so sturdy and well-built that I doubt I'll ever need another - but if I do, I'd replace it with an identical one. Highly recommended.",99
306,"This is a very well designed garlic press. It is a very simple design, and has very few parts which creates virtually no waste and also makes it easy to clean. There is a red grid made of hard plastic that helps push out all the garlic from the holes.<br /><br />The chamber where you put the garlic can hold 2-3 cloves at a time. The interior of the press is flat which helps prevent any garlic from escaping. It has comfortable, rounded rubberized grips that make it easy to use. You can throw it in the dishwasher no problem.<br /><br />I have been very impressed with this tool so far, and I'm just racking my brain to see what else I can use it for because its so nice to use. I really have come to love OXO products for their quality and smart design. This is another success .",99
307,"I like the oxo grips very muche.<br />Easy to use, large chamber to crush w or even3 cloves.<br />Very easy to clean.<br />I would be even happyer with it if there was less garlic left in the chamber as i think too much is left uncrushed.",4.0

312,"&#34;Why didn't I buy this earlier?!&#34; - I said out lout to myself after using this thing for the first time.  Now I don't have to chop and mince cloves of garlic anymore.  I could just put a large clove of garlic and squeeze the press and add garlic directly to what I happen to be cooking.  Not all of the clove of garlic would be turned into tiny pieces, and a thin film of garlic may be left as a remnant inside the garlic holding basket.  But that's perfectly fine to me.  This press is sturdy and very easy to wash.  I literally threw out my old garlic press after I bought the XO press.",5.0
313,"The OXO Good Grips Garlic Press feels pretty chunky in hand, but the soft handles make it comfortable to use.  The large size means that you can mash bigger cloves or several smaller cloves at once.  It's designed so that you can reverse the press to clear out the holes using the built in cleaner, which is a pretty neat extra feature.<br /><br />It's dishwasher safe, but I haven't yet had to put it in the dishwasher.  The press is very easy to clean out and rinse off under the faucet.  I haven't had any problems with garlic getting stuck.<br /><br />I'm usually not a fan of OXO products or their soft-grip handles, but this garlic press is great and the price is good too.",99

I am fond of the rubber handles because the grip increases with less effort.",5.0
315,"I do really like this garlic press.  I was able to crush two good sized cloves of garlic at a time because the compartment is that large.  The little rubber things on the other side push the stuff out of the holes when you're finished.  I really like that this goes through the dishwasher and comes out beautifully...not all dull looking like my old aluminum press (that didn't do as good a job!)  Thank you OXO for another great product.  Now...the downside of that big compartment...this beauty does take up more space in the gadget drawer, but I'm willing to make the room.  I'm back to using whole cloves again instead of jarred garlic!",99
316,"Good Points:<br />1.  Solid, reliable construction.  Heafty, powerful feel, nothing cheap about this item, which is something you expect from OXO.<br />2.  Crushes garlic perfectly every time.  We grow elephant garlic here, and that requires cutting in half, but great smooshed garlic every time.<br />3.  Cleans up nicely and retains its good looks.  Requires a quick brushing to clean the silicone prongs, but that takes seconds.<br /><br />Bad Points:<br />Have never discovered a single negative item in the 8 years I've been using this product.  I only replaced the item because it disappeared somehow (I think a guest may have wanted the old one).",99
317,excellent garlic press.,5.0
318,"I use a lot of garlic in my recipes and wanted a great garlic press. This one fit the bill perfectly - it crushes the garlic easily and I don't get 'spits' of garlic flying as often.  I've found I use half the amount of pressure I used with my previous garlic press.  As well, no more digging out the pieces with a knife after each garlic - just flip the tool and the reverse handle has a cleaner side that pushes out the remains.<br /><br />The handle is large enough to be comfortable but not so large that storage becomes an issue. It also cleans very easily after use.  In all, very pleased!",99
319,"I love the weight behind this garlic press. i have had a lot of them, and so far this is the best- comparable to those fancy ones you can buy at WS in the mall, or PC parties. I have used it for cooking at home and preparing many Italian meals. It works great when pressing and pretty good at cleaning. A few places could use some extra pushing out, but nothing like the cheap ones that claim to elf clean and do nothing but smash it back through. I throw it in the dishwasher on the top rack and it comes out clean. I would buy these for gifts fro family and friends if they needed one.",99
320,Perfect for arthritic hands.  Heavy duty and durable.,5.0
321,"I have always found the chore of chopping garlic tedious and time consuming, but I never added a garlic press to my kitchen arsenal. When given the chance to try OXO Good Grips Garlic Press I just had to. This works perfectly. The handle is nicely cushioned and doesn't require much pressure to mince the garlic. It presses the entire clove and nothing gets stuck in the press (I've found that to be an issue with other kitchen tools). It is easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. Great product that I highly recommend if you're in the market for a garlic press.",99
322,"There's two kinds of people in the world and I'm the kind that believes that the phrase &#34;there might be too much garlic in it&#34; is preposterous. I probably own four different garlic related extraction devices.*<br /><br />The OXO has improved over the old model both in terms of cleaning--which is simple and easy to do, and in terms of having a good soft, forgiving grip. This is a wonderful device and apart from wasting a fair amount of the garlic because it is hard to get off and leaves some of the inner walls of the garlic clove on the device, it is just about perfect.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*Of course, you do not need to extract your garlic. One of the best ways to enjoy garlic is like my daddy taught me. You soak whole heads of garlic in water for 20 minutes to an hour or more if you have time. Then put those garlic heads on the top layer of a grill or bake them until they are soft and mushy. You can spread the result on bread or crackers and it is superior to all butters and most cheeses.",99
323,"I know, I feel a little odd getting so excited about a garlic press.  But when you're in the middle of cooking something and can't find the right tool or struggle with a poorly designed tool, it's frustrating.  The OXO garlic press is awesome.  It's easy to use, easy to clean (which is the best part) and presses out nice little chunks of garlic just begging to be tossed into pasta or slathered on bread.  The handles are comfortable, and the tool itself is solid.  It has a handy cleaner attached to the back for the peel and any stray bits that happen to get stuck.  Best garlic press ever.",5.0
324,"This press takes unpeeled garlic cloves and extrudes them in the form of little chunks of garlic. The garlic this press produces looks like finely minced garlic. Clean up is a snap as you can rinse the peeling out of the press and the reverse the tool to get out any remaining chunks. I like this press very much. I don't think I'll throw away my Zyliss garlic press, though. It produces a creamy texture of pressed garlic for recipes where you don't want the individual chunks. However this is hands down the easiest to use and clean press I've ever tried.",99
325,"For years I've been buying minced garlic in a jar because I didn't want to be bothered with trying to mince it myself.  I can't really figure out why I didn't try out a garlic press sooner, but now that I have one I'm pretty sure I won't be buying that jarred stuff again. Easy enough to use, just pop in a peeled garlic clove and squeeze over your bowl, pot or pan. Flip the handle over and press to make sure you get it all, then toss it in the dishwasher for easy clean up.",99
326,"We are trying to cook more at home. Garlic is a great addition to most dishes. For both taste and health reasons. The Oxo allows you to easily mince garlic and add it to dishes without having to spend time chopping.<br /><br />The press is heavy and easy to use. But I do get some residue left each time I use it. Not sure any other press could do better. And overall we are adding more garlic because of ease of use, which is exactly what I was hoping for. Recommended.",99
327,"What can you say about a garlic press? Well, for starters, this one is built like a TANK and is super sturdy. If I dropped it I wouldn't be afraid it would break - if fact, I'd be afraid it would break something. I tried it out on several cloves and it worked great. The cleaning side is very cool and makes for less of a mess when cleaning. All in all this is a great device to have in your kitchen drawer if you cook with garlic at all. Five stars from me.",99
328,Hands down the most-used tool in my kitchen. I've had mine for almost five years and it's still as sturdy as the first time it was used. It fits several garlic cloves at once and the plastic prongs on the back make cleanup quick and easy.,5.0

330,This is a fantastic garlic press that is easy to use and presses that garlic well!  The handles are a nice size and are easy to grip and squeeze.  The press is well built and feels sturdy enough to last a long time.  I love that it's dishwasher safe and have thrown it in the top rack of the dishwasher to get washed with no problems.<br /><br />3-12-16 UPDATE:  I'm still using this a couple of times a week or so and still love it!  It has held up well!,99
331,"Not much to say other than this is perfect.  It's easy to use and easy to clean.  Flip it over and you can get all the garlic out so there is no waste either.  The handle is comfy and the garlic presses out with ease. I've had a garlic press in the past that ended up worthless because the metal press corroded and broke, but this doesn't seem like it will have that problem because it's much thicker. OXO products are always high quality and this is no exception.",99
332,This is a really great garlic press. It presses harder and gets more garlic than any I've had before. It's also a breeze to clean because the red park on the back can be used to push out garlic that is stuck in the holes.,5.0
333,"I have had mixed feelings about OXO items. Some don’t seem to be as well-constructed as others. Well, so far, these Garlic Grips are AWESOME. MY last pair broke in half while crushing garlic with them. I do not see that as an issue with these. They are sold, well thought out in design. It’s always a pain to get a little knife to scrape out the garlic bits. LOVE THIS and would give it as a gift; my highest praise!",5.0
334,"Garlic just makes dishes better, and then having a good garlic press is a must.<br /><br />Since this is a very basic item, I will not say much. However it is a very good quality garlic press. It is sturdy, solid, and easy to use. The silicon cleaner at the back is also a nice bonus. Overall, instead of wasting money with cheaper stuff, buying a solid press once and for all will be a better choice.",99
335,Every thing you would expect from OXO  Works great and is very durable.  Will last a long time.  OXO  Does it again.  No wonder the Test Kitchen highly recommends them~,5.0
336,Worked great for a few years until one day it cracked right of while I was trying to press a garlic. It wasn't overfull and it wasn't a particular big garlic either.,4.0
337,Wonderful tool.  Saves so much time in kitchen.  Red piece pops garlic residue out.  Very nice to have a one piece garlic press.  Convenient to use and very easy to clean!,5.0

339,I love it!!! I bought it in TJMaxx 2 or 3 years ago and it's like a new one. Works great!!!,5.0
340,"This garlic press is fantastic. It feels very heavy and sturdy, crushes the garlic very well, and I love how you flip it to the other side to get the rest of the garlic out. This makes for easy cleaning. Very pleased and highly recommended!",5.0

343,"I use garlic all the time, but this is my first garlic press.  It's heavy and very sturdy.  I was able to press cloves pretty well without much effort.  The handles are comfortable and easy to grip.<br /><br />After you press your garlic, then you flip the handle around, and the silicone part releases all the extra garlic so very little is wasted.<br /><br />I found this simple to clean.  Hand wash it immediately after use, and it easily comes clean.<br /><br />I plan on this lasting for a long time!",99
344,I love the heft of this garlic press. It doesn't feel cheap (and it isn't). The rubber nubs for pushing all the garlic pieces out the holes is perfectly aligned - there was NOTHING left behind. Great tool!,5.0
345,"This garlic press is really solid and sturdy. It gets the job done, and I especially love and appreciate the cleaning function that helps get the garlic out of there. Nice product.",99
