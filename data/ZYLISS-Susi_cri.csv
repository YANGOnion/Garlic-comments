0,Not very good.  Leaves a lot of garlic in the press.  Not near as good as a Pampered Chef Garlic Press.<br /><br />No peeling?  You would have to be very strong.  The peel wraps the clove and the minced garlic does not pass through the peel.,3.0
1,More expensive than better IKEA items out there.<br /><br />It's a pain to clean and to remove the crushed garlic. The cleaner provided is useless because it just bends when you try to get the garlic out.,2.0
2,"Worked well the first time. Cleaned out nicely. When I used it again, it clogged, and the cleaning tool didn't clean the press. I haven't used it again. I don't understand all the positive reviews.",1.0
3,"Didn't remove all the skin, faster to just use a knife. Waste of money, thank goodness it was cheap",1.0
4,"Difficult to press, once the garlic is pressed it has to be scraped off. Not what I hoped but it's ok.",3.0
5,"After reading Cook's Illustrated's recommendation of this press, I was all  set to love this press and tried several times to change my mind, but I just didn't.  Instead, I bought a Calphalon garlic press that I think is a much better one.<br /><br />Pros of Zyliss:<br />(1)It does press most of the garlic out.  Slightly more if the cloves are prepeeled.<br />(2)It can press a few cloves at once.<br />(3)It comes with an attached cleaner, which is hard to lose.<br /><br />Cons:<br />(1)  It is hard to squeeze multiple cloves, especially if the cloves are unpeeled.<br />(2) If you want to press multiple batches, you have to clean out the peels from the previous batch before proceeding.<br />(3) You do need to use the cleaner (or a bamboo skewer or other pointy device) to get the smashed peels out of the hopper.<br />(4)If the cloves are unpeeled, the garlic left behind is particularly tough to clean out because the holes are slighly recessed on the inside of the hopper.  It is difficult to get anything in there that is effective at scrubbing the garlic out.<br /><br />The Calphalon garlic press has built in spikes on the plunger.  It pokes through the garlic skins and makes it easier to press the garlic.  The skins stick to the spikes so when you open it back up, you just peel off the skins and move on to the next batch (or leave them, add more garlic to the hopper and keep pressing.)  It doesn't allow garlic to squeeze up past the plunger.  However, IF you decide to peel the garlic first, it does leave more behind than the Zyliss and it is then harder to clean the remaining garlic off the spikes.  (Unpeeled, both the Calphalon and Zyliss leave a similar amount behind.)  Not being willing to do any more work than is required, I simply solve that problem by not peeling first.  A toothbrush works great to clean off anything stuck in the spikes.  The only other down side to the Calphalon is that the hopper is a bit smaller (normal size as opposed to Zyliss' oversized hopper), so you may need to do multiple batches if you are pressing a lot of garlic.  But it is easy and in the end, less time consuming to use and clean than the Zyliss.",99
6,"This is the second press we have purchased. We really love the press but the quality is not the best. The first one lasted about 1 year... We just purchased another one about 1 MONTH ago, and the metal pieces that press the garlic, BROKE. I am not a strong person and am upset that we just spent money on this again to have it break 1 month later. Huge bummer!",1.0
7,"It not what I expected,for the price, I thought it would do more!",3.0
8,"My older Zyliss (20 years old!) did a much better job if getting the most out of the garlic clove. This one, while certainly more efficient, leaves a lot of the garlic clove un-squeezed.",3.0
9,"I had the same brand garlic press for years and loved it. I used it often and always washed it in the dishwasher. Eventually the coating wore away after about 15 years and left a black stain on everything. This one seems to be as good or even better than my old one. I'm going to hand wash it though.  Maybe it will last a lifetime then.<br />After less than a month of use and only hand washing the item, the coating is starting to come off. What took over 15 years now only takes one month so I had to reduce the stars for this.",3.0
10,Excellent product I highly recommend this item for you.,3.0
11,"Had a zyliss press for years that we loved - the pin finally gave out so I bought this.  After 10-15 uses, the metal snapped and the section with the holes broke off entirely.  It was too late to do a straightforward return - am now working on getting a refund.  After emailing was offered $4 for the slight damage... see picture above of the slight damage!  Waiting for a call back from customer service.",1.0
12,"The garlic receptacle... barring a more informed name, is too small, the metal it's self is of decent quality but the physics of the press are off and the floppy press part is annoying. The little cleaner thing that comes with it falls out if not careful esp while pressing, and mine ended up getting eaten in the disposal and now looks a hot mess.  If you use lots of garlic and actually cook frequently look elsewhere. This seems like a product for a sorority girl not a serious everyday ...cooking person..",2.0
13,"I've had a Zyliss garlic press for 20+ years which I really love.  I've never found another brand of garlic press that presses garlic so effectively. My boyfriend didn't have a garlic press so I wanted to buy a 2nd one to keep at his place.  To my surprise, Zyliss no longer makes the ""normal"" size garlic press.  I bought the jumbo model, but my biggest complaint is that it is simply too big and unwieldly in my hands.  Maybe a male chef with giant hands can use this thing to squish 3-4 cloves of garlic at a time, but I don't have the strength.<br /><br />Fortunately, it wasn't hard to find a vintage Zyliss garlic press, normal size, on eBay.  I got one that looks like it was never even used.  Now I'm happy again!",3.0
14,good job,3.0
15,"Meh.  I'm not really overly fond of using a press, but it does a good job.  Does clean well.  It's a bit heavy and somewhat difficult for my arthritic hands, but I do use it occasionally.  It's just not that great for me personally.  You might find it to be the next best thing since sliced bread.  Had I known the things I know now, I doubt I would have purchased it.  Definitely not for the elder persons hands.",3.0
16,I bought this thinking it would be easy to use and easy to clean. It is not a bit better than a cheap garlic press I had. It actually is difficult to clean. I never use this and paid way too much for it.,3.0
17,"first of all, it is true--you will have to apply a lot of pressure to use this instrument. you can't fit more than 2 cloves of garlic in press. when you try to press two cloves as opposed to one, you do have to apply even more pressure. the cleaner that comes with it is helpful but it can be really hard to remove the garlic that is on the outside face of the press where it comes out. i need to scrape it with a knife just to get the garlic that i have pressed off to be used in cooking. pressure and time applied for use and having to clean it each time i press it and the great energy and force needed to press the garlic makes it worthless. i can do it the old way which is peel the cloves and use a grater. the old way doesn't hurt my hand and i save time. i was really hoping this would be something i can use in the kitchen and save myself time and mess. its not. back to grater.",2.0
18,You need a man's strength to close the handle and press the garlic.  This is going to lay in the drawer while I keep using my old one.,3.0
19,When the handle broke on my old garlic press I decided to find a really good one and unfortunately I relied on the reviews.  Many of these people must not have ever used a decent garlic press if they think this one is so great.  It is very light weight aluminum with a little swivel foot for the pressing. I really don't get the swivel because I find it annoying to line up. My old one was just two solid pieces with a pin hinge and to clean you just flipped it backwards.  This Zyliss has a little plastic cleaner that you have to take out and line up with the holes to clean. One more piece to get lost.  Very disappointed.,2.0
20,I give it a three stars because that fact that the package was open and clearly not a new product and it shouldn't be priced as new. But it does work well.,3.0
21,"The utility is great, but I really wish the material was better like stainless steel. I have a feeling that if not properly cared for, the material will corrode or rust.<br /><br />The built-in cleaner is a plus and overall, I like the item.",3.0
22,"The jumbo version is much better after having both due to the amount of garlic cloves each can accommodate.  This one is good for small quantities used i.e. 1 clove at a time.  But high quality regardless, 2 stars for amount of cloves it can use each time while the Jumbo one surpasses this in much greater quantities of cloves used at an instance.",3.0
23,"Yes, it does mince garlic.  But it takes a fair amount of elbow grease to mince it (compared to other garlic presses I've used).  And I'm also not impressed with it's &#34;clean-ability&#34;:  the &#34;teeth&#34; on the included rubber cleaning tool aren't long enough to fully push leftover garlic out of the mincer holes.  I've found other mincers easier to clean than this one.  I'll keep this around as a spare, but I'm ordering a different one from Amazon as soon as I finish writing this.",2.0
24,I was all set to love this garlic press.  I had used the smaller version for almost four years.  But within three months it broke.  The screen the garlic passes through came out rendering it useless.  I have tried to contact the manufacturer because I am sure it is still under warranty but they have not responded to my email and the pix I sent along with it.  So I am frustrated because the tool is in the garbage rather than in my utility drawer.,1.0
25,"The zyliss Susie garlic press is definitely sturdy, but unless you peel the garlic cloves before using the press, it takes a great deal of pressure to extract the garlic. I found this disappointing. The press cleans easily and the self storing tool is useful.",2.0
26,"Plus side, rices garlic quickly and well, minus side doesn't seem to press more than 85% of the clove, leave a lot of left-over. Plus side the cleaning tool is brilliant, makes what is usually a pain in the %$# cleaning job (with a toothpick) into a snap, minus side, I have already bent the handle some from just a few uses, I expect it will snap or bend into uselessness after a short life. I like it and wish it were a little stronger.",3.0
27,"I lost my Pampered Chef garlic press to the disposal (the disposal survived, but is noisy).  This doesn't have the solid feel that the Pampered Chef had.",3.0
28,The plate which presses against the garlic broke off the two arms just after one month of use.  Any chance of another  replacement?,2.0
29,"I had the smaller version of this press for years, and it worked fine and remained together all that time. Less than a year ago, I thought it would be nice to get the larger size. This press worked just like the small version, and I was happy with it until it broke in two. The pin that holds the two pieces together came out, and it is impossible to fix without drilling a hole all the way through the two pieces and inserting a different pin.<br />I hope I can locate my old press.......",2.0
30,Pressing garlic is easy and into a nice mince.<br /><br />Big con is the cleaning. They give you this cheap plastic tool and after a month or so the nubs that are supposed to push through the holes begin to bend. Since the tool is useless now...i have to scrape and work at getting the remaining garlic out of the basket.,3.0
31,"Very time consuming to get garlic out even with the little extra tool. It works ok for crushing to remove the papery husk, but for chopping it's a waste of money, unless you are someone who just doesn't want the smell of garlic on your hands.  It's faster and more efficient all-round to smash and chop with a good knife.",2.0
32,"This press works well if you don't mind the pealing finish getting into your food.  I purchased it again when this started to happen and the new one was significatly of lower quality and broke the 1st time I used it.  I will attach a picture.  Now I have purchased a Rosle 12782.  It is twice the price, but easier on my hands, fully stainless steel and easier to clean.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/R-ouml-sle-12782-Garlic-Press/dp/B000063Y8F"">R&ouml;sle 12782 Garlic Press</a>",1.0

34,"The cleaner tool it comes with makes it even more difficult to clean the thing. I just use my fingers and rinse it under water. Other than that the tool works pretty good, but keep looking since you're spending the money I'm sure there's something better.",3.0
35,It functions great but the plastic accompaniment to help get the garlic unstuck quickly gets bent and useless.,3.0
36,The garlic press feature is great and you don't even have to peal the garlic. The blue cleaning piece however is not very robust and the bristles bend after just a few uses so it becomes more difficult to clean over time.,3.0
37,"Not as good as another one that I got as a gift.  This one is difficult to clean, whereas the other one has an extra part that swivels out to make cleaning a breeze.  Plus, on this one, the enamel has started to wear away, whereas the other one is stainless steel.<br /><br />I still use it as a backup, but not my favorite.",2.0
38,"comparing to other garlic presses we used in the past, this one needs strong muscles because it is very short",3.0
39,"This slim and modern looking Zyliss Susi garlic press is attractive, easy to store and does press the garlic. I find it somewhat difficult to remove pieces of garlic from the press and to wash the press. I'm hoping this is just part of a learning curve. I've only used it twice thus far and am hoping the process gets a little sleeker.",2.0
40,Broke after two months use.,2.0
41,"This item did NOT work well as the single Garlic press, requires too much strength to use,thought that having the cleaner attached would make it better the previous cleaner got misplaced eventually) I actually only need the cleaner for my old Zyliss,it works like a jewel and works better and more comfortably!",2.0
42,"I always check Amazon reviews before I buy a product and have found them generally accurate.  So why did I not listen to the several reviewers who said that arthritic or small handed people should avoid this press?  COOKS magazine got me, plus all the 5 star reviews. BUT PLEASE LISTEN UP if you are afflicted with either condition.  I could not get any garlic out of this press.  The OXO leaves residue but is much easier to squeeze. Should have stuck with what I had.Mickey Dachs",2.0
43,"So.. I have had a few garlic press's in my time and thought this was 'my forever press'. It was smooth, simply, and easy for even my wife to squeeze.<br /><br />The problem came at the 8 month mark i was using it for dinner (a dinner party where i had garlic in various dishes and had to mince numerous cloves) and the damn thing just broke. The bottom screen part that dices the garlic just came out.<br /><br />We hand wash this and take care every time..<br /><br />Now this is a 1 star going in the trash.",99
44,I purchased this because I had a Zyliss garlic press before that lasted almost 20 years.  This one pressed well. . . . while it lasted.  After only 10 months it broke at the place where the press is attached.  Very disappointed.,2.0
45,"The key to this thing is that you can press garlic without peeling it. Not so. In fact, it' more like a waffle iron for garlic. To get all the garlic you have to open it and pull out the garlic gauze. Not a fan.",2.0
46,"like others, this works fine, but after awhile the coating comes off, it appears to be paint off the aluminum but i'm not sure... i've been trying to remind myself to reach out to the company to see if this paint is harmful or not... but until then, I don't use this...",3.0
47,"The description said it was for extra large cloves. IMO it is so not. The photo sneakily exaggerates the size of the masher by the angle it's taken. It is 2/3 that size.  This press is for your average to large $2.99 lb garlic bulb, and is made of a cheap metal. No heft at all. If you buy extra large ""elephant garlic"" like me, this is not the press for you. I sent mine back. Luckily, I also bought a Berghoff 6 piece orion bar set on Amazon. The Orion comes with a fantastic heavy duty extra large press. I didn't need all the set's pieces, but really looks great and also has an awesome peeler and corkscrew. NEW EDIT: Please read the comments section for my review, as there is an interesting point that Elephant Garlic is not horticulturally true Garlic. Unfortunately, they call it Garlic at the grocery store, so  I based my review on the expectation that the extra large garlic easily available is termed ""Elephant Garlic"". If you just buy regular loose BIG garlic, the Susi 3 might work perfectly for you. I had given the item only 2 stars, and that is just my own assessment.",2.0

49,I don't find this item easy to use & clean.,3.0
50,Compared to the one it replaced its not good.  Works fair.  Cleaning device in handle falls out during when you are squeezing.  Cleaning is a chore compared to my standby-difficult at best.,2.0

If there is more than one clove of garlic in it, I can't compress it at all - my husband has to do it.

I think if the press were made of a heavy metal instead of a cheap plastic it would probably be better. I am sticking with my Oxo Steel.",3.0
53,not as great as my old zyliss garlic press. but adequate.,3.0
54,Worked well before it broke (where the press is attached to the hinge) after less than 1 year of use.,2.0
55,Good except a little difficult to press thru for small hands like mine. Also garlic pressed out are a little too fine.,3.0
56,nice press but the pressing piece broke off during first use. amazon is replacing the press for a new one. i hope it lasts.,3.0

67,I have to really squeeze to press the garlic. Most reviewers seemed to think that it was easy to squeeze. I can get the job done but with more work than my 25+ year old Zyliss Susi. If the press is filled with garlic the handles are very far apart and require both hands with fingers spread out more than the old press. Even with a single clove it requires considerable pressure. I have larger than normal hands. My wife cannot use this. It does have a larger capacity and there is no leakage. If only I used it I'd rate 4 stars. But since the wife can't I have to trim a star off. Small or weak hands may have to look elsewhere for a press.,3.0

72,Not strong enough.  Flimsy.,2.0
73,"Yes, this new larger size garlic press can squeeze up to 3-4 cloves at a time of garlic.  No problem!

74,"I am an able-bodied cook with decently strong hands.  I have been using garlic presses for 14 years. I couldn't get a single piece of garlic, peeled or unpeeled to mince through this thing.  I asked my husband, with stronger hands, to give it a try and he was able to make it happen with considerable force.  After a week of frustration and sore hands, I gave it to my five-year-old son to have.  He would probably rate it at three or four stars because he thinks it is a great toy and it does a superb job of shooting play-doh through the holes.  In my experience, when buying a garlic press you should buy one that has prongs that grasp the garlic while pushing it through the holes.  In my opinion, this is definitely not a good garlic press.

Apparently there is some kind of finish on the aluminum, or maybe it is an aluminum coating that is coming off. Regardless, as soon as I noticed that, I tossed it in the trash and ordered a Rosle.

It holds a lot of cloves at once, which can speed things up.<br /><br />The bad: put a lot of cloves, or unpeeled cloves, in and it's REALLY hard to crush them. For a product advertised as &#34;No Need to Peel,&#34; that's bad. The handles don't provide enough leverage to make it even close to easy.<br /><br />Also bad: the cleaner thingy is made of flexible plastic so if someone in your house (I'm not naming names) isn't careful and doesn't push it in just right, the little points bend and it never, ever, fits through the holes again.<br /><br />The worst: the plate that actually does the pressing is only attached by thin aluminum struts.

I even set it on the edge of my counter and put my weight on it and the garlic just barely came out.  Have now replaced it with another model.  Save your money.",2.0
94,"I've recently reviewed the Kuhn Rikon, so I thought I should put my two cents in about this press as well, since it is the one I use.<br /><br />This press does a very good job with the mince, but it has some deficiencies and design flaws.<br /><br />The first two problems have to do with longevity --<br /><br />The alloy is inferior, and over the years metal fatigue will catch up with it and the handle is likely to crack near the basket. They do use a stainless steel hinge pin(the only stainless part on the whole press), but that is not enough to make this a ""lifetime"" utensil. Also, the finish doesn't last, mine is already getting scuff-marks and scratches.<br /><br />The second lifetime-shortener is the little cleaning tool. As a plastic item separate from the press itself, it is just a matter of time before it accidentally goes into the trash with some food waste, or gets ground in the garbage disposal. Also, being plastic, the little prongs on mine are already getting slightly warped and bent, making it tedious to get it lined up properly with all the holes at once. Once that goes, the press will be such a pain to clean that you'll prefer to get a new press.<br /><br />Another flaw is the little nubs on the bottom of the plunger. This is a tempting thing for a garlic-press designer, but it is counter productive. At first blush, one imagines that these little protrusions will help push the last little bit of garlic through the holes. In practice however, they do just the opposite! Imagine, if you will, the moment when the plunger is about 1/8 inch from the bottom. The basket is full of smashed garlic, waiting to be expelled, but now something's blocking the holes! The little nubs impede the passing of the last of the garlic through the holes, and actually force it to go out around the plunger head, creating more waste. Having both the head and the basket very, very flat is the better design.<br /><br />Zyliss does a good job at keeping the plunger and basket diameters very close, which is a key characteristic of a good press.<br /><br />The Kuhn Rikon was better in the past, but they seem to have changed their manufacturing process(along with lowering the price), resulting in a product that is markedly inferior to what it was before.<br /><br />I have many presses because I did a personal research project a couple of years ago, out of frustration. The Susi 2 is the one I use almost daily. So many look good, but just don't work right for one reason or another. Forget about Farberware or Oxo or any of the common brands. They waste garlic and/or produce an inferior pulp. This is the best press for the money at the time of this writing(January 2011).",3.0
95,"I was SO disappointed in this garlic press, the first and only time I tried to use it, the metal started bending on the handle because of the amount of force I was putting in just to crush the garlic clove.  I had thought that the Zyliss brand was of high quality, but this press makes me question that assumption.  I was expecting it to crush an unpeeled clove and that could have been a mistake on my part, but ever since I saw the Frugal Gourmet using his that way, that's what I was looking for.  I have since seen other brands that will perform that very function, leaving the peel neatly held in the &#34;hopper&#34; and all the garlic nicely crushed and ready to use, so I don't believe that I had unrealistic expectations for the Zyliss.  Still, very disappointing overall, especially considering it wasn't exactly cheap.",1.0
96,Product broke in dishwasher after just one week of use,2.0
97,"Worked fabulously for about 9 months , and then the pieces that crushes the garlic cracked off. For $20 the press should have lasted longer than that.<br />Very dissapointed.",1.0
98,"I have had this tool now for about one month.  I am one of those people who prefer the strong flavor of pressed garlic as opposed to minced garlic.  This device presses the garlic and ginger finely and efficiently, with or without the peel. The peel stays put in the press while the cloves are forced through the grid.<br /><br />Now the caveats:  I have lost some grip strength in my hand.  In my opinion, this device is not easy to operate given my health condition. For those customers, women and men alike, who are stacked pretty well, the operation of this device should not present a dire problem.  However, those of us with medical conditions may be intimidated.  I started out pressing one large clove, but, it was challenging.  Consequently, I cut and pressed half of a glove at a time and it was deemed  manageable.  However, it takes slightly longer which I don't mind.<br /><br />The flimsy plastic cleaner attachment is inefficient at cleaning the garlic press because it lacks sturdiness.  It bent out of shape while using it. For this reason, I peel my garlic cloves prior to placing in the press.  In fact, I feel like this method yields a little more pressed garlic.<br /><br />Finally, I am legitimately concerned regarding the quality of the finish.  It appears that it may flake off as time progresses, possibly leading to food contamination/poisoning.  I prefer to hand wash it in an effort to protect the finish, and, so far it has maintained its appearance.  It is fair to assume that everything in life falls under the mantra - 6 of one; half of dozen of the other.",3.0
99,I had an original Zyliss that lasted decades. I loved it but it eventually wore it. This one broke after less than 5 months. The press completely broke off and was stuck in the garlic. Not sure why the newer models seem a lot more brittle than the older.,1.0
100,"Take a look at the images I uploaded that show the coating flaking off.  I started out as a big fan of Zyliss products, but having used them for a couple years, I've realized that some of the products are poor quality due to the cheap matte metallic finish that wears away with regular use & hand-washing.  This garlic press is one such case.  I always use scrubbers intended for non-stick pans, but this wear still occurs.  And who knows what kinds of chemicals are in the cheap finish they use?  Looks great out of the box, but they show their age before long.  I notice this particularly on this product and on the ice cream scoop.  If Zyliss used the identical design, but made it out of plain stainless steel, I'd be thrilled and would give 5-stars.  For comparison, their pizza slicer and peelers ARE stainless steel and are fantastic 5-star products.",1.0
101,"I've owned about half a dozen garlic presses over the years, the last of which was an Oxo Good Grips (with grips that slip, fill up with water in the dishwasher and then drip that dishwater all over whatever you're cooking when you try to use it) and this Zyliss press is hands down the best of the lot and absolutely worth the premium you will have to pay for it over the sorts of presses you can buy in the grocery or discount stores.  I find it easy to use, even with several large cloves of unpeeled garlic in it.  The woman complaining about it being difficult to use probably has arthritic hands and I would think that the overwhelming majority of people age 10 and up should have no problems with using this press.  Since I bought this press several months ago, the one and only time I touched the jar of store-bought minced garlic that has been sitting in my fridge for the past year was to throw it out in the garbage.  This is easy to clean too, especially with the handy plastic cleaning tool.  If you like to cook, buy this press.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />EDIT 12/13/11:  After about 3 1/2 years of near-weekly use, the plastic cleaning tool that came with this became only partially operable - it lost some of the tiny nibs that clean out each of the holes in the face of the garlic press and other nibs became bent so that they do not fit.  This makes the press harder to clean, but if you rinse it immediately after use or soak it for a few hours in a glass of water, the old garlic comes off easily and it will rinse clean under the tap, ready to be put in the dishwasher.  I wish the cleaning tool was a bit sturdier, but otherwise its still a great garlic press.<br /><br />EDIT 2/1/16:  Shortly after writing that last update, the non-stick anodized-looking finish on the press started flaking off, sometimes into food, which is not a good thing.  A lot of the negative reviews of this garlic press describe the same thing happening.  So much of the finish has come off the perforated face of the press that I think it's now just bare metal, so I guess the problem has stabilized somewhat, but that's still a sign of a manufacturing and/or design defect.<br /><br />The plastic cleaning tool is now basically useless on the nubbed end - the flat end can still be used to scrape garlic out of the perforated face of the press.<br /><br />And apparently I'm a bit obtuse and chauvinistic, too.  I initially thought that anyone should be able to use this press, but over the past few years more and more my wife has been calling out &#34;Oh Honey!&#34; and handing me the garlic press to use when she is cooking, commenting that it is just too difficult for her to squeeze all the garlic out (peeled garlic at that - unpeeled cloves require probably 30% more effort to press).  So I guess this press just isn't as easy to use as I thought.  Maybe I need to find one with longer handles to give more leverage.<br /><br />So, to be fair, I've reduced my rating to 3/5 stars from the original 5/5 stars and I'm now shopping for an easier-to-use garlic press.",3.0
102,"After a year of solid use, it broke today! For the last year it has been amazing, but I guess the smaller aluminum pieces finally buckled under the pressure.

104,"I purchased this b/c my last garlic press died on me, and I use a ton of garlic when I cook. I use at least 4 cloves everyday, and peeling and chopping them can be a pain. The Zyliss does have a few things going for it: it's large, it does a good job on unpeeled garlic (just be sure and remove the skins with each new clove), and the little head cleaner (blue spikey thing) tucks away quite securely and does a good job of getting all the nooks and crannies clean.<br /><br />However, I just couldn't give this one five stars. For one thing, it's a pain to use. Literally. I'm don't have the largest hands in the world, but they're not abnormally small either, yet I couldn't comfortably grip the hands when a clove or two were in the chamber or push down without causing immense discomfort. Once the plunger went down a little, it became a little easier to squeeze, but for the intial process, I usually have to place the bottom handle on the countertop and push down with both hands (with my weight behind it) on the top lever to get it started. Now, I could just accept this as a necessary evil except for one thing: I've had better.<br /><br />Overall, it's an o.k. press, but it's not one that I'll purchase again.",3.0

I should probably try to return it!",1.0
106,"I had an older, small Zyliss press that worked just fine but finally gave up the ghost.  Ordered this based on the great reviews (crossed my fingers and ignored the few not so great reviews).  I am a woman with average hands and strength (please don't ask me to define average), but pressing a clove of garlic through this thing was a real workout.  First, it is a rather large press so getting your hand(s) around it for good leverage is a stretch.  I tried it with peeled and unpeeled garlic.  I snipped off the garlic tips.  I cut the garlic in half.  I put only one clove in at a time.  Still, it required a huge effort for me to press the garlic through.  Called my husband and, although he could manage it, he, too, thought it was much too hard and uncomfortable to deal with.  Not sure why there is such a difference of opinion on how easy/tough this is to use, but I am going to purchase something smaller and hope for the best.",2.0
107,Works great but it broke after 2 month of using it twice a week.,2.0
108,I had this garlic press for a bit over 2 years and it just broke last week-end.  I think it's a fairly good time though I was hoping for longer at this price point.  I did use it almost every day and crushed whole unpeeled cloves with it.  Clean up was OK but not the easiest - there is a little rubber tool that comes with it but the teeth bent and broke within a month.  I also noticed the paint coming off in some spots as another reviewer noticed.  Will be buying a stainless steel press next time.,3.0
109,"I bought this press a couple months back based on reviews and brand.  We own a couple other Zyliss products (parm. cheese grater and can opener are a couple) that have held up well, and are great products in design and ease of use.  While this press does accommodate larger cloves (or multiple) and does in fact press garlic, I found that it was hard to use.  The pressure/strength needed to actually press the garlic was above and beyond what my kitchen skills were up to. I asked my husband, and he agreed it seemed exceptionally hard to press.  We've had a couple other presses (one generic, one pampered chef) that also pressed well and didn't require the same sort of exertion.  I've finally given up on it, and gone with a more ergonomically designed one I picked up at target (the michael graves one).",3.0

It takes a lot of strength, using both hands, to get this to work because the holes the garlic is pushed through are very small.  Using unpeeled garlic isn't recommended because most of it gets pushed up instead of down because the small holes clog quickly. It failed completely, after about 1 month of use, when I put about 3 cloves of garlic in, gave it a pretty good squeeze and the entire bottom plate with the holes separated from the rest of the press.  When I buy a new press I will look for something sturdier.",1.0

I just pop in one to three unpeeled garlic cloves (depending on their size)and squeeze. Instantly I have my garlic pressed, minus the peel. The peel is easily removed from the ""bowl"" of the press. However, here is the down and disappointing side. This model of Zyliss press does NOT have a cleaning tool with it. If I had realized that, I would not have purchased it. Do you realize how long it takes to pick the garlic out of all the little holes!!!! Please, Zyliss people, make a cleaning tool for this model!!! Tell me where to get it. Otherwise, this is going to end up in the giveaway bin at my house.",99
114,"The Zyliss Susi 2 press is good in all of the ways reviewers have already mentioned.  However, one big drawback is the &#34;wearing away&#34; of the aluminum surface on the face of the press which occurs when scraping off the crushed garlic.  These particles end up in your food--not a good thing!  The manufacturer needs to address this health issue and find a fix.",2.0
115,"I purchased a Zyliss Susi 2 garlic press and passed on my older Zyliss (original Susi) to my daughter.  The older Zyliss had a flat surface on the plunger that seemed to press out more of the garlic.  The newer Susi (which has a different plunger surface) leaves more garlic in the bowl.  Mine did not come with a cleaner, but I was able to clean it by running under water and scrubbing with a toothbrush.  This loosened the leftover garlic and was pretty easy to do.<br /><br />While it worked, this was a decent garlic press.  Now the bad part.  The pin that holds the two parts of the garlic press together kept coming out.  I would replace it and it would last for a while until it would come apart again.  The last time it came apart in my wash water, and the pin disappeared down the drain before I had even realized the press had fallen apart yet again.  So now I am left with a totally unusable garlic press.<br /><br />For the price of this garlic press, I should not be having to look for a replacement.  I will certainly not be getting this item again.",2.0

After a few moments of thought, there is no hope for this garlic press.

If they cast the arms to connect in 4 places it would last longer.",2.0
117,"I prefer the older round design of the Zyliss, was easier to clean.  This one seems well made and functions well to press the garlic, but with the rectangular ""basket"" it is harder to remove the garlic skins from the corners after each use.  The included tool for this purpose doesn't work as well as my alternative:  an unbreakable plastic (camping) dinner fork.  The fork and this press live next to one another in my drawer.  The fork is more rigid than the included cleaning tool, (yet, because it's plastic, the fork still does not scratch the garlic press).  So the tines of the fork allow me to really pry out the garlic leavings, and also to scrape off the pressed garlic from the face of the press (to get it into the bowl).  Cleaning and using this press would not be as simple without that fork.",3.0

With the cleaner, it works, great.  Press the garlic out, and drop it in the dishwasher.

On that matter: it never really worked well.  I have good hand strength and using this press was more effort than it was worth to have crushed garlic.  Another issue: the metal is coated in some sort of finish that chips and flakes away, probably into the garlic that it presses.  I wouldn't want flakes of any sort of coating in my food, but the fact that this item is made in China just about guarantees that the questionable, flaking material is toxic.  For those of you considering that the problem with the finish might reflect a recent reduction in quality control at Zyliss: No.  I purchased this press at an upscale kitchen store at least 5 years ago and have used it maybe 20 times.

160,"I may have received a faulty one.  I canot get this to press out the garlic.  I am following the instructions, but the galic gets pressed down and then clogs.  Nothing comes through the holes.<br />Seems like a losy design to me.",1.0
161,"Based on other reviews, I expected more out of this garlic press. It only crushes SMALL cloves easily. Large cloves are fairly impossible to crush without brute strength and the flimsiness and lightness of this press makes it even harder. It does not clean so well either- bits of garlic get stuck in the holes. The garlic press also seems to retain the garlic smell which I think is due to it being made from plastic. I will be buying a regular stainless steel garlic press.",1.0
162,"This as a new and ""improved"" Zyliss press. It does not come with the plastic cleaner the older model used because it has a ""nonstick"" surface. It is very difficult to remove the peels left after pressing. The holes have to be cleaned individually with a small probe like a toothpick. Difficult and time consuming. I have sent multiple e-mails to Zyliss asking for cleaning suggestions. Zyliss does not respond.  The companies lack of interest in customer satisfaction is very informative. Don't buy their products.",1.0
