0,This garlic press worked great for us until recently when the piece within the handle came apart and won't go back together. This item has done great with light dishwasher use (mostly hand washing).  We have been using it for 8 months and now it will need to be replaced.,3.0
1,it's ok. precision fit not like the product it replaced — press surface tends to catch on the receptacle.,3.0
2,"no good, too much aggravation digging garlic out of presser.  might save some time from cutting it by hand.",1.0
3,The garlic get stuck in the groves and I have to use a knife to scrape it out and off.,3.0
4,Extremely disappointed. If you are a serious garlic eater don't buy this product. We use garlic in almost every dinner we make and it was done after one month. Lightweight metal bent out of shape and is now unusable. Don't waste your time. Spend a little extra and get a better press. I wish I had.,1.0
5,"It works, that's what I'm gonna say. But it's really tiny that only can fit one small-medium sized clove. It's also a little bit hard to clean, comparing to those that could flip over the back side.Besides, I found it being out of shape after a month.Overall  I thinks it's an ok product to thinking about its price.",3.0
6,"It went direct to the thrift shop.I would send it back, but it is not worth the freight.",1.0
7,Brent and misshaped the first time I used it... On garlic.,1.0
8,"Owned for 6 months. Use this more than once a week and LOVE it, but maybe I use it too much? The handles and or the press part have bent slightly. It now doesn't quite close all the way and doesn't work as well as it used too.",3.0
9,"it is easy for smaller hands, but the garlic still not crushed on the side.",3.0
10,I used this press about 10-12 times over a 2+ month period.  The hinge screw broke and now it's unusable.  Don't recommend.,2.0
11,Not stainless steel.,1.0
12,Doesn’t always line up like it should when you go to press.,2.0
13,Bought this with the understanding that it was stainless steel as the title indicates. Make sure to note the description says &#34;zinc ally&#34; which I assume means zinc alloy. Item is heavy but the mechanism feels quite flimsy. Very disappointed given the high rating.,1.0
14,Same situation as another 1 star reviewer wrote. After several uses the round reservoir bent into an oval and the garlic now squeezes out of the sides. I hurt my finger squeezing it together after it bent and threw it away. waste of money.,1.0
15,Item did not meet my expectation. Questionable quality. Came packaged in a manila envelope. Has some calcium buildup on head of garlic press (see picture in review).,2.0
16,"This is a FABULOUS press. Does everything I hoped it would,I gave it a 2 because it suddenly fell apart.  Not sure if I got a dud or not but the metal pin that acts as a hinge popped out after only using if a dozen times.",2.0
17,"Looked great, but after only a few uses the sides budged out and it now extrudes more garlic from the oval sides of the cup than through the holes.  Stay away.",1.0
18,"Well made and sturdy, but about half the garlic squeezes out of the sides and it is difficult to clean.",2.0
19,"Bends w use, I had to use a wrench to bend it back every day after 1 mo, now it's my back up press, cannot use daily due to softness of metal.  I use it as a ginger press.",1.0
20,Cheaply made. Flimsy.,1.0
21,Deformed on first press.,1.0
22,Broke after the third use.,1.0
23,Already broke do no,1.0
24,"The product is OK, However I don't think it worth so much money.",3.0
25,Handle broke off after using for 3 weeks,1.0
26,Im disappointed i used twice the plastic &#34;black&#34; falling apart.,1.0
27,"Seems solid enough, but both the plastic inserts (not soft as the pictures would lead you to believe), fell out on the first use.  Its also hard to clean out all the holes that the garlic is pressed through.<br /><br />As for use, its performs as intended.",2.0
28,Shoddy construction on a cosmetic element. It is an otherwise fine garlic press. Next time I will buy a different press with a solid metal construction without cheap plastic bits that have no good reason to be there that I can discern.,2.0
29,plastic piece came out after only one use,3.0
30,"I hate this garlic press. The garlic squeezes out the sides and most cloves do not fit in it. I almost gave this 2 stars for being mostly metal, but the seam between the plastic and the rest of the press is annoyingly misfit.",1.0
31,"Product arrived dirty/damaged. Had some crud in it, almost looked like it had corroded or something. Returned.",2.0
32,This garlic press was really messy and difficult to clean. I wish I didn't get it,2.0
33,"The build quality of this item is exceptional, however, the chamber is too small to be used effectively for most pieces of garlic. The circular chamber doesn't fit garlic cloves well, which are typically oblate in shape, so a rectangular chamber would've been much better. While the press is easy to use, the extrusions on the top surface are unnecessary and make it impossible to press garlic with the peels still on since the extrusions press the skins through the bottom.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is a product that's well built but poorly planned. I wish I had gotten a garlic press with a differently shaped chamber.",2.0
34,"I bought this because I was tired of hand mincing garlic...well looks like I'll be going back to hand mincing. I've used this garlic press twice now. I was preparing meatballs, and pressing garlic into the meat and didn't notice the handle screw fell off. Thank goodness I felt it while rolling a meatball or my guests would have bitten into a nice chunk of screw. Needless to say I will be searching for something higher end next purchase.",1.0
35,"Most of it is not made out of stainless steel. Maybe one little bolt is or something, but it's made out of some sort of cast metal with some sort of finish material over it.<br /><br />Also, half the garlic squishes up around the edges when you press down rather then out the bottom.",1.0
36,"This was such a dissapointment. I'm a pettite femaile and I trully have week arms, I usually go to my husband to open jars and stuff for me LOL. I just used this garlic press on 1 large clove of garlic that i chopped in 3 pieces. After pressing down 2 pieces the &#34;head&#34; totally distorted and became oval. I could barely separate the pieces. I really wanted this to work since I wanted stainless steel press not the old one that was sturdy but kept loosing the paint after a while.",1.0
37,I am trying to replace an old garlic press that apparently had a sort of &#34;coating&#34; (looks like a thin layer of paint) that has roded and peeled off over time. I don't want to be eating whatever is peeling off. I purchased this because the title says STAINLESS STEEL. What I failed to notice is that later on it contradicts this and says &#34;alloy&#34;. When it arrived I see there is a similar apparently &#34;sprayed on&#34; coating to my old press. I can see it around the holes of the press and it can already be peeled off a bit. This is exactly what I did not want. So I am not even trying it out. It is getting returned.,1.0
38,Very good .. but it broke when I added the garlic without cutting it to smaller pieces because I usually slice the garlic then put it in the press but when I added the garlic without cutting it it snaped!the two nails on the head got loose so the two holders separated,3.0
39,The garlic press works well but you must clean it properly or the pulp will stick. It was advertised as stainless steel but unfortunately  it appears to be a coated alloy.,3.0
40,Not sure why it has so high rating...?<br /><br />I like the minimalist easy to clean design but the garlic doesnt get crushed as beautiful.<br /><br />It just smears from every direction :(,1.0
41,not worth it,2.0
42,It's really difficult to get the garlic out that you have pressed.  It is just smeared to the outside of the press.  I think it's too late to return,1.0
43,"Bought in January...the canister you put the garlic in is now bent and shaped like an oval from pressing the two handles together. The circular plate sometimes cannot fit in, unless I pull it apart enough to bend the sides of the canister back out into a circle shape.<br /><br />Am I really strong enough to bend STEEL? Or is it not really steel in the parts that matter...<br /><br />I can't see it lasting too much longer. &#34;High-quality,&#34; my a**.",1.0
44,Arrived broken. Attempt to fix and it's a very loose product and doesn't line up well. Returning. Don't waste your time or money,1.0
45,"I purchased these thinking the slimmer design would be nice but just don't like the way they work. The gap around the plunger seems to be a little too much so garlic squeezes around it instead of pressing through the holes. Also, one of the plastic pieces on the grip fell off after a few uses so I am still looking for the perfect garlic press.",1.0
