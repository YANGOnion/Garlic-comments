0,"Concept is good, but holes the garlic is pushed through are way too small. It mashes the garlic and you loose a lot. If the holes were larger it might be good. Would not recommend...",2.0
1,This thing works great. My daughter loves the tube thing. It's difficult to get the fibers out of the slots where the strainer part is bent when it's made. Clearing the holes is expected but you almost need to use a tool to get the fibers out of the two slots. Other than that it's perfect. We us it almost daily.,3.0
2,"Garlic comes out back and sides, lots of wasted garlic that does not get pressed out. A pain to clean",2.0
3,Does a decent job but it is very difficult to clean. Unlike other presses that reverse to push the clogged garlic out of the holes in the press this one does not. Also there are small slits in the side of the section where you press the garlic where it gets stuck. You end up getting you hands just as smelly cleaning the press as if you just chopped it by hand.,3.0
4,Not sure why product has so many good reviews! For the price is not even good! Its very hard to clean stuck inside garlic and they don't even offer free returns. I would want to return the product but I guess I'm stuck with it!,2.0
5,"Saves my fingers from mincing garlic. However, the press leaves way too much garlic stuck inside the gadget for my liking. Cleanup is more than a rinse, more like scrub and remove the garlic from the narrow spaces. I'm going to buy a jar of minced garlic instead of this mess.",3.0
6,"I like this, but the garlic always gets stuck in the corners where the sides meet, which makes it a little difficult to clean.",3.0
7,"Wish it was built more heavy duty, wish the middle part didn't swing around for no reason",3.0
8,"Cleaning not nearly as easy the ole Pampered Chef.  No nifty little tool to poke the holes like PC.  No, it didn't say there was but did say cleaning was easy.  Don't know what other reviewers were talking about.  Score one for the bad guys.  I do like the rubber skin remover.  I use it all the time so not a total loss.",2.0
9,"So this works as a garlic press, but my main complaint is how annoying it is to clean. It's got a lot of crevices that you have to pick the garlic out of by hand. Additionally it does not work at all at pressing ginger. It kind of just smushes it and all you get out is a few drops of ginger juice.",3.0
10,"I tried using it with ginger, like it states it can be, but it just kind of mushed it and seemed like just juice was coming out. I don't really understand the purpose of the 2 pieces not being connected. It mostly just gets in the way when I'm trying to wash it.<br />It minces garlic as it should but, I bought it because I thought it would do ginger too.",3.0
11,"Wanted a garlic press because constantly cleaning out my mini prep from garlic was getting annoying. I am used to my mothers 30+ year old press that works amazing. Thought this would be great but it was hard to press, get the garlic off and cleaning the inside corners is tough. My mini prep is WAY easier to deal with. I wanted to like this but I'm sure it'll just sit in my drawer until I give it away.",2.0
12,Works great but VERY hard to clean,2.0
13,"I was looking for the Rosle press, and figured this would be just as good. It's okay, but not nearly as good as the Rosle.",3.0
14,"I bought this for my girlfriend thinking it would be an upgrade to her really old-school press. The truth is, it has more moving parts (more to clean) and only holds a tiny bit more garlic than her old one. She doesn't find the roller to be useful. The press is well-made and heavy and does give you extra leverage when pressing a lot of garlic at once. It also comes in a nice package which is useless unless you want to gift it because who's gonna put it back in the box after they use it?",3.0
15,"Expensive, is well made but it didn't work well,  I found it not very effective in mincing garlic and cleaning out the press.  I was disappointed in this gadget.  I now just use a small paring knife to make tiny diced garlic.",2.0
16,"No better than the others.  Not really sure why the hopper swings out, doesn't make it any easier to clean.",3.0
17,I bought this because I read a review which rated this item very highly.<br /><br />The handle bent on the first use and it's not easy to clean. It does mince garlic quite well. Works as it says it does but the quality of materials is a bit disappointing.,3.0
18,Hard to press.,2.0
19,"Does the job, but it's not as user friendly or easy to clean as the OXO version you can get.",3.0
20,Eh.  I don't know why everyone gets so excited by this model.  There is a strange seem in the folded metal of the basket where garlic gets forced out and its not particularly easy to clean.,3.0
21,Decently uniform mince produced. Basket isn't one solid piece so chunks get caught in there. A lot seems to be wasted due to the basket design. This is a pretty heavily constructed product.,3.0
22,"It's easy to clean, but when you have to peel the garlic first before it works well. Other presses can be used without peeling the garlic first.",3.0
23,Seems to leave a lot of residual garlic in the press.,2.0
24,Very disappointed in this garlic press. I felt like to be able to use this you'd have to have great muscles to press them together. Cleaning it was a pain. You can save time chopping the garlic yourself. Now it's just going to take up cabinet space.,2.0
25,I was disappointed that this more expensive garlic press did not include the garlic remover/plunger that my far less costly one did. This one will require you to pick out the pressed garlic pieces with your fingernails or a fork or knife.,3.0
26,"I guess it's okay but I think it's overpriced.  I'm fine with it but not thrilled with it.  The peeler makes no sense to me.  Cleaning it is not easy.  I have to rinse it out first and use my finger to dig up the mashed bits and then run it through the dishwasher.  Sometimes I really have to strain hard to press the garlic.  Sometimes I can't and I have to call the man over to do it.  It presses okay but a lot gets stuck.  I don't know...I guess this is one of those things that I thought would make my life much easier but it barely does so and I'm left feeling slightly annoyed with this purchase.  I think I can run over to HomeGoods and buy one that does the same thing for much cheaper but since I have it, I'll use it.",3.0
27,A little hard to clean but I'm very happy all of the parts in the press are attached. My old garlic press was in multiple parts and inevitablely all the pieces would be difficult to find when I needed them. This had simplified that.,3.0
28,its ok,3.0
29,"Average build and quality. Hard to clean. There are 2 cracks on the female part of the press head. Garlic pieces get stuck in these cracks and need to be picked out with a knife point or a toothpick. This is because the head of the press is stamped, not forged as it should be. Had I know about this issue I would not have purchased.<br /><br /> It also does not come with any &#34;self cleaning&#34; insert that fits in the holes of the press that makes the business end easy to clean. This is not the fault of the press, merely my own oversight. These cleaning inserts do make life easier and had I been more aware at the time of purchase I would have rethought it.",3.0
30,"Meh. Was expecting restaurant quality.  It works, but feels cheap and is pretty messy to boot.  The silicone peeler is basically useless.",2.0
31,"This set is ok. Yes, it will get the job done, but cleanup it a real pain with the different nooks and crannies in the press. I wish it was fully enclosed, as some of the garlic will get stuck in the sides.",3.0
32,"I only gave it 3 stars because while it does do what it says it will do, it's not exactly the same as a regular peeler and it's a bit pricey. Now, you can easily use it normally and peel your garlic first. But, how cool is it to not bother and just toss the whole thing in there? Well, that depends on how particular you are about the consistency of the end result. It almost juices the garlic when you put them in unpeeled. It's a little more effort to squeeze (as expected) but a lot of the garlic's moisture seeps out and is not worth trying to recover. I'm not exactly a gourmet chef so I'm not sure if matters at all. What you end up with is more of a garlic mash. It still has little chunks like you expect from peeled garlic through a press. I'm not sure if that matters in cooking but there it is; something to be aware of.",3.0
33,The garlic press works decently but has too many moving parts and hidden areas to clean.  Not impressive like reviews suggest.  Wish I would have just bought another Zyliss which was simple to clean and use.,3.0
34,It more smashes the garlic.,3.0
35,It's an okay product.,3.0
36,"It works, but two very annoying things about it:<br />1- The piece with the holes goes up and down along the frame. Garlic will get trapped between this part and the frame. It is VERY hard to clean, even manually. Never got it out of the dishwasher clean.<br />2- The compartment where the garlic goes is small. You won't be able to fit a bigger garlic clove in there.<br />Oh and forget about the easy peel thing, doesn't work (and I mean both, the silicon piece and peeling while pressing).<br /><br />Overall, I had better one before and it was cheaper than this. 20 bucks is a bit too much for this product.",2.0
37,Great concept but I haven't used it yet and it's been a while since I bought it. I guess it's a better idea if you buy your garlic already peeled and only need to crush it.,3.0
38,Just doesnâ€™t seem to work well.,2.0
39,"Nice all metal construction, but it's not quite as easy to use and especially not as easy to clean as the Oxo garlic press I have.",3.0
40,OK but difficult to clean.  Should provide some kind of cleaning tool as others  do.  Stainless steel is positive feature and price was reasonable.,3.0
41,It works fine but cleaning is not easy especially the sides,3.0
42,"It works very well to crush a peeled garlic, not so much a clove of garlic with peel on. You have to press very hard if you're using a clove of garlic with skin on. Didn't work that great with ginger.",3.0
43,"This is a stainless steel mincer with a garlic peeler included.  The product is well made, dishwasher safe and easy to use.  It received 3 stars for 2 reasons.  First, it is over-priced for the functionality.  This mincer does nothing that a less expensive mincer can not do.  The addition of the peeler is nice but does not add any value to the press.  Second, most of the less expensive presses include a tool to press out and clean the holes in the mincer.  This one does not have a clean out tool, so it is much harder to clean.  I would recommend this to someone who loves to clean small holes and stainless steel.  It does, however, come in a nice box.",3.0
44,"I've tried it just putting the clove in;  I've tried it using the peeler; I've tried it peeled and cut the ends off; and I've tried it peeled and quartered.  It doesn't matter... more of the garlic clove stays in the press than gets minced out.  Plus some of the garlic squeezes through the side seam of the hopper.  If I mince by hand with a knife, I can generalize that one clove well produce roughly 1/2 teaspoon.  With this press, I have to measure... and the results are generally around one clove equals 1/4 teaspoon.<br /><br />The only plus is the peeler.  The set comes in a nice box suitable for gift-giving.",2.0
45,"This product is just OK.  I read all the reviews before buying and thought there must be something special about it....but there isn't. It doesn't come with a clean-out tool, which in my opinion, is a major disappointment, epsecially at this price.  It is not easy to clean.  The handles are significantly larger than my other presses.  This does not present a problem for me but my wife finds it difficult to use.  On the positive side, it comes with a garlic peeler.  It also comes in a very nice box but honestly, I'd rather spend a few dollars less and do away with the fancy packaging.",3.0
46,"The perfect garlic press has yet to be invented. This one does the job, but the corners of the metal basket are difficult to clean after each use.",3.0
47,Works good for mincing garlic. But for ginger it does not work as expected. The garlic peeler is useless. Takes more time to clean it than it saves time to peel the garlic old way.,3.0
48,Does not clean as simply as advertised,3.0
49,"It works. I don't want to say it's hard to clean, because it is really not, but I used to have an ancient one that only had two parts and it worked like a dream.",3.0
50,fun to clean....not so much,3.0
51,Not all garlic comes out of the press. Much is squeezed into the split constructed holder (the part that holds the whole cloves).  Then you have to struggle to clean out all remnants.  It would be better if the holder (for the cloves) was a fully sealed - and didn't have 2 splits in the metal.,1.0
52,"I like the garlic press it works really well, however did not receive the peeler and just realized this . Sad!",3.0
53,"I don't have that much strength to squeeze together, it was so hard to do so I quit. Look so nice and made sturdy,  I bought 10 and gave Christmas present,  but I haven't ask them if they like them.",2.0
54,Bought as a gift.,3.0
55,"bought two, one was going to be a gift.  After I tried mine I returned them both.  Fancy but not functional.",1.0
56,ergonomically poor; need to shape the handles to be compatible with the human hand.,2.0
57,"Not at all good product , bought this one over oxo as read so many good reviews.. but i think there is some problem in tool as it does not work for me never get the proper garlic.. so not at all happy. Not at all a good tool for garlic",1.0
58,Is not very usseful,3.0
59,"I am sorry to say that it doesn't work.  All it does is squash the clove and then I can't get it out.  It does not mince, even when I fully scraped off the outer shell.  I am going to return it.",1.0
60,The peeler didn't work as well as I expected. The press works okay. Don't buy it if you want to get a peeler & press combo deal.,3.0
61,"I think the makers had their heart in this, but for me it is bulky.  I don't care for the rubber tube to remove the skin....that's easy to do on my breadboard.  It is too big , and doesn't clean as well as a Suzie.",3.0
62,Not sure why it's so popular. Worst press I've ever had. Garlic gets stuck on the sides and it's pretty hard to get out. The peeler is awesome but that's pretty much it. If I need to clean it for 5 minutes it's not worth it. I would return it if I had kept the box.,1.0
63,"I own this and have used it for a year. It's okay. It's built with quality construction and material. This is a critical review of it's design that some reviewers claim is a benefit.<br /><br />Don't buy this thinking that having 3 hinged pieces is a feature. Having the chamber swivel separately from the frame and handle has no benefit. It's a drawback.<br /><br />1. It's just another piece to clean, 3 instead of 2. It actually adds about 6 to 8 more surfaces to clean, depending on what you count as a surface: the outside of the inner chamber, and the inside of the frame that holds the chamber.<br />2. It's slightly awkward to open it all up to where you can rinse it and run water over all the surfaces. The chamber keeps wanting to fall back into the frame, but you have to rinse in between.<br />3. When you press some garlic, and want to open the chamber, to clean it or press more garlic, you have to hold the chamber piece down with your thumb in order to open it up. Otherwise, the plunger stays in the chamber. You cannot just use the handles to open the chamber.<br />4. Now you've got garlic juice on your thumb.<br />5. Now your thumb smells like garlic. (I know, you had to touch the garlic to put it in the chamber, but that's not quite as messy, and not a problem caused by the designed of the press.)<br />6. The chamber is actually open at the two outside edges (hard to describe - it appears to be made from a flat piece of metal that was bent into a basket, but the edges are left open), and so garlic gets stuck in those slots, making it harder to clean. And yes, garlic frequently gets in the slots.<br /><br />Several reviewer are under the delusion that the swinging chamber makes it easier to clean. No it doesn't. It would swivel if it were two pieces, and would be easier to clean. It doesn't get anything out of the way. It only gets the handle out of the way, but that's no advantage because you still have to clean the handle frame piece itself. At least, if you use a lot of garlic like I do, and you press more than a tiny clove, then garlic and juice gets all over all three pieces. It's not like you don't have to clean the frame and handle too. If you do only use a tiny clove, then it's not as much of a drawback.<br /><br />Also...<br /><br />1. I wish the handles were a little longer so it would be easier to press with more leverage.<br />2. I wish the chamber were a little bigger, since I eat a lot of garlic.<br />3. I wish the plunger fit into the chamber tighter to prevent garlic from being forced up and out of the chamber instead of through the holes.<br /><br />Also, the idea that you don't have to peel the garlic is bunk. It's not any more or less true for this press than any other. You can try, but frankly, no press is going to work very well if you don't peel the garlic. That's not a fault of this press, but of the product description.",3.0
64,There is one critical flaw in this garlic press in my opinion.  The &#34;basket&#34; where the garlic sits has small slits which has trapped garlic every time I have used it.  It requires me to use the tip of a knife to scrape the garlic out of these slits.  Not a huge deal but annoying enough to purchase a different design.,2.0
65,You better be patient to be pulling the three pieces apart each time you squeeze one clove and want to load the next.  I don't know why they had to make it loose like that it may wash easier but it slows my cooking considerably.  It works well but this feature supposedly to aid in cleaning makes it not worth it for me!,3.0
66,"This is clunky. Garlic got trapped on the sides, so when I went to reload the parts stuck together. I am so mad I threw the packaging away! I was replacing an OXO brand. I ordered a new OXO today. It is much easier to clean and no parts to get stuck together!",1.0
67,I have no idea why there are so many good reviews.  It is very difficult to clean.  Garlic gets stuck in the holes but also in the seams.  It's hard to explain but you will find out the hard way if you buy one.  I had the Oxo garlic press before until the handle broke.  I wish someone made a decent garlic press.  I'm going  back to a new Oxo for now...at least until it breaks again.,1.0
68,Ok! I spent the extra money because I thought it would be the most awesome tool!<br />But..... It is not. Not really.<br />It is a good garlic press....but not the miracle tool it says it is. It does the job - just like any other halfway decent garlic press. It is stainless steel and therefore does not bend as easy as the discount plastic versions. That is the only benefit. Not really worth the extra dollars.<br /><br />My old press had little &#34;nobs&#34; on the reverse side that used to force out all the stuck garlic in the holes - easier to clean. This press does not have that feature.<br /><br />Bottom line: Good tool - I won't spend that money again.,3.0
69,"This  garlic press is terrible to use and to clean because it does not have a built-in cleaner to push out the garlic peels.<br /><br /> I used it once and bought another one that I love:  OXO Good Grips Soft-Handled Garlic Press<br />by OXO.  Large-capacity garlic chamber<br />Efficient hole pattern maximizes amount of garlic pressed<br />Built-in cleaner pushes out garlic peels<br />Sturdy, die-cast zinc construction<br />Soft, comfortable, non-slip handles absorb pressure while squeezing, Dishwasher safe",1.0
70,"It's very well made from high quality stainless steel and in a sturdy box. Also the peeler does a great job. But there are two problems with the tool unfortunately.<br />1. The size of the chamber is small so you can't fit a large garlic clove in.<br />Though I don't care that much about it because the bigger problem is:<br />2. You have to put a lot of pressure for the garlic to come out grind. The reason can be the shiny smooth part that is for pushing garlic down or the short handles. The longer the handles, the less power you need to apply for the garlic to come out. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with arthritis and consider it a bit overpriced. Somehow the problem should be fixable with a better design!",3.0
71,"cant figure out how to clean it or use the sleeve for taking off the skins. usually a garlic press has a device to stick in the holes to clean it. tis comes apart but that isn't helpful, you need to pull out the mess with fingers, not easy.",3.0
72,"Press works fine, but the 'free ebook' was pretty much a scam.  First, it requires an email address.  I used a disposable one, and it's now getting a bunch of spam.  Second the website gets angry when you have any sort of ad blocker installed.  Even with ad block running there were still bogus 'update chrome' pages that came up with dialog boxes that were hard to close.  Anyone who is not fairly tech savvy and tries to get this book will likely get their computer infected with something.<br /><br />I don't care how good the product is, when I am getting scammed I am unhappy.",2.0
73,Whoever makes one of these that's easy to clean will be a millionaire.,3.0
74,This was very difficult for me to use as it required too much sytrength to crush and then open. I returned it,2.0
75,"Pretty average. Nothing special about the press, but works. The peeler thing really doesn't work at all.",3.0
76,Open end causes garlic to jamb in crevice making cleanup very difficult.  Found many of this design on Amazon - all with the same problem.,1.0
77,"Complete junk. Finish was peeling inside the press and there was unremovable glue everywhere. I returned it and got a nice $15 Oxo at Bed Bath and Beyond, which works great.",1.0
78,"I bought this due to its rave reviews but I don't care for it much at all.  The construction is sturdy and I really appreciate that it's made out of steel but the design leaves me very dissatisfied.  Why does the 'basket' part exist on a hinge?!  It makes it so challenging to load it after the first clove because the excess garlic makes the basket then stick to the upper handle and it has to be pried apart for each successive clove.  Additionally, the basket has (slightly open) seams in its corners; the smashed garlic gets wedged into them which makes clean-up less than a breeze.  I loved my old Zyliss but wanted a steel replacement.  I see OXO has one rated better than the Zyliss (and it has a built-in, rather than separate and therefore easy to misplace, hole cleaner) so I'm off to give it a try.",1.0
79,"I bought this to replace a garlic press I owned for 5 years or more. I had to return 'this' item due to a manufacturing defect. The band around the bottom of the handle was cracked which is odd, because it's made out of metal. I chose not to reorder because the product was too flimsy in the garlic pressing parts for my preference of a garlic press. The packaging of the product however was extremely nice.",1.0
80,"Great product, great transaction!!  it's cheap. Totally worth it. Good value for price  I just order a second set 5 minutes after I received them. Exactly what we were hoping for. Very inexpensive in comparison to other options on the market",2.0

82,"My issue is with the garlic crusher.  It has bold, strong looking handles, looks nice.  However, the pin where the two levers connect looks like about 1/8 inch.  I don't know how it will hold up, but that seems quite thin, and that is where all the pressure concentrates.  I would feel much better about the product if the pin was 3/16 or 1/4 inch.  I like to know a product will last for life, and I am not so sure about this one.",2.0
83,Bought in march and it already broke in only 5months.  Appears to be cheaply made.,1.0
84,Not as advertised. You can not just place an unpeeled garlic inside and it will get minced. You have to peel it first.<br />Not at expected at all.,1.0
85,"Hard to squeeze, would rather use a knife to break.",3.0
86,"Terrible quality, shoddy construction, impossible to clean.",1.0
87,"This is a set of a peeler and press for garlic which is nice to have together. Now I have enjoyed using this set but to be honest there are better products out there. The garlic peeler is on the flimsy side and does not withstand more than one clove of garlic and if you do not remove all the skin the press gets clogged and is hard to get clean. But, not a bad set and for the price is a good deal and you do get minced garlic out of it, just not easily. I do think this is a good starter set also for those starting to cook or who may not use garlic religiously. I recived this product complimentary for review purposes.",3.0
