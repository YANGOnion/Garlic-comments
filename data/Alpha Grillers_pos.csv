0,"I cook all the time.  Not only do I prepare all of our meals from scratch due to family diet issues, but I have a large, organic garden and I preserve food from it all the time.  I love food with flavor so I use lots of peppers, onions, ginger and garlic!  I have worn out several garlic presses in my lifetime.  The last one literally broke when I tried to press ginger into some water kefir.  Tired of cheap crap, I got decided to find a quality garlic press.  Noting the life time guarantee, I purchased the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press and Peeler Set about a year and a half ago and have been using it just about daily ever since for both garlic and ginger.  It is fantastic!<br /><br />WHAT IS IN THE BOX:  Beautifully presented in a lovely gift box, I received both the stainless steel garlic press plus a silicone tube garlic peeler.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE:  I have been using this garlic press for a year and a half and it looks as nice today as it did when I bought it.  It shows absolutely no signs of wear.<br /><br />This press feels solid and durable in my hand.  Use has proven it so.<br /><br />The stainless steel construction allows me to wash this in the dishwasher and I do.  Every time I use it.<br /><br />The silicone garlic peeler is much nicer than I expected.  Every year I make a couple of gallons of homemade salsa and peeling the garlic took forever in the past.  I started using the silicone peeler for my garlic and it revolutionized my garlic peeling process.  It works fast!<br /><br />Because I am no longer replacing my garlic press every couple of years, I will save money.<br /><br />This press works for ginger as well as garlic.  I have used it with ginger a few times and there isn’t the slightest bulge or bow where the garlic/ginger comes out.<br /><br />I am normally wary of rounded handles like this because they can hold water when washed.  I have NEVER had any water issues with this press.<br /><br />WHAT I DON’T LIKE:  I love this garlic press.  There is nothing I do not like.<br /><br />PICTURES:  I am including various pictures of the press in my hand for a size reference.  I have small hands.  I also have a picture of the part that extrudes the garlic.  It shows no signs of wear after a year and a half of constant use.<br /><br />I purchased the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press and Peeler Set at FULL PRICE.  I love this set and highly recommend it.  It definitely deserves 5 stars!",5.0
1,"This garlic press is strong and well made of stainless steel so it won't rust.  The round handles are comfortable to squeeze and don't hurt my hands.  Clean up is easy, just put it in the dishwasher.  A neat little bonus is the garlic peeling tube.  Just put an unpeeled clove in the tube and roll it on the counter with the palm of your hand.  It works great.  This Alpha Grillers Garlic Press comes with a cool box for storage that is lined to protect the peeler.  A must for every cook.",5.0
2,"Quality kitchen gadget.  Made of quality metal.  Great for the price.  I hate when I buy an inexpensive kitchen gadget and it is junk I just throw in a drawer.  This little press I use almost every week as I LOVE garlic in my food.  I've been on a heart health kick so I'm mixing fresh chopped spinach, garlic etc into ground turkey and making the most delicious burger patties!  The roller helps too, easily removing skin.",5.0
3,"Love it! I had a grocery store garlic press that I used for years and was always unhappy with the cheapness and the amount of garlic left behind. Then I came across this gem. I saw the great reviews and decided it was time for an upgrade. I am not sorry. I was impressed right away with the quality and feel. It presses 100% of the garlic through, where there is no waste. I love it! Thanks for putting a great product that works on the market.",5.0
4,"I have a love/hate relationship with garlic presses, honestly. I've had them fall apart in my hands, cut me, and be impossible to clean-- generally creating more work for me and wasting more time than the press was supposed to save! So it was with some trepidation that I ordered this, and I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. This press is sturdy and very well constructed. I pressed several cloves of garlic in a row on my first use, and found the pieces easy to separate (not come apart, but the top of the press has three pieces that separate on a huge) and wash. Very pleased-- and the peeler that came with the press is also incredibly handy!",5.0
5,"Broke 2 and the other two I bought were terrible, hard to grip and the plastic container broke. This Garlic press is just great and I love the press is attached, easy to clean and washes up great. The garlic presses out to such a nice consistency, not mushy or to big. The garlic cleaner works great, really nice. Had no problem with the grip size, it is study and easy to handle. Would buy again.",5.0
6,"I do not use fresh garlic very often because I find it really hard to peel it, and break it down into small enough pieces to cook with.  With this garlic press, I can now peel it, and press it to the right size.  The press is made from stainless steel and is fairly light weight.  It's not very large, so it fits perfectly in my utensil drawer.  Clean up is easy, and it is dishwasher safe.  A great kitchen must have!!",5.0
7,"Wish I had this kitchen tool years ago!!! When I received this in the mail, I was ready and waiting with garlic bulb in hand!! This great garlic press is just that, Great!!  Does exactly as advertised! I am preparing meals with fresh minced garlic and no mess, no cutting board and no sharp knife. Preparing garlic now takes only a few seconds, literally, and right over dish on the stove if I so choose. Cleans up exactly as advertised also! NO MORE PEELING!!!!!",5.0
8,"I've been using my peeler and press for at least two months now, and they are both great! The peeler makes short work of removing those pesky garlic skins and is a snap to clean, and the press squeezes out perfectly tiny garlic that gives my food that great strong garlic flavor without having big visible pieces of garlic in it, and woohoo is it a snap to clean, also! I simply squeeze out the garlic and then take the press immediately to the sink and run forceful water over it and throughout the basket until all traces of garlic are rinsed away. If there is any smooshed garlic stuck in a corner or whatever, I simply use the sharp pointed end of a knife to move it right out and then the water takes care of any final traces. When I do my dishes later, I give the press a dunk in the water and a quick once-over swipe of the dishrag to remove any last traces of garlic scent, and that's that!<br /><br />UPDATE 7/20/2016: The set is still going strong and working great!",5.0
9,"This is THE best garlic press I've ever owned and i've been through a couple. It crushes the garlic so well leaving just a tiny bit in the press itself. I would recommend this press to anyone who lovessssss them some garlic... There is nothing better than owning a perfect press, i find myself adding extra garlic just to use it lol. Now the peeler I can do without, to me its faster to just peel it with a knife and keep it moving. It did peel the garlic but it hurts a little but rolling it.",5.0
10,"After going through different presses (most worked o.k. at best) and having most of them break I finally got the message - yeah, a little slow on the uptake.  What initially seemed to be a pricey garlic press turned out to be a delight to use.  Simply, it WORKS!.  Beautifully.  As advertised.<br /><br />There really is something to be said for price versus value.  Thanks, Alpha Grillers.  Quality has its own value.",5.0
11,This garlic press is definitely something anyone should add to their list of very useful kitchen items. First off it was very well packaged- came in a nice box that I think i will keep just to store it in instead of in a drawer or whatever else....which leaves me to my next point. That's how nice this product truly is. You can tell by the weight of it once taking it out of the box that it is not cheaply made but durable and will last a long time. Items like this are hit or miss and this is seriously one of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon. And at a cheap price also. And thanks to the seller also....they evidently just started selling not long ago on Amazon and are already worth 5 stars in my book. And they sent me a coupon code for a digital kitchen thermometer which I have already bought today...can't wait as I feel it will be just as nice. But this garlic press is pefect....minces perfect and easy to clean. 5 stars...100% worth the value and I'm 200% satisfied. Hope they continue to sell great items like this.,5.0
12,I have owned a lot of garlic presses.  I cook almost daily and our family goes through a lot of garlic.  I had yet to find a press that could keep up or last very long.  That was til I got this one.  It is so sturdy and durable.  I have had it for a few months now and have crushed plenty of garlic and it's still like new! I also really like the garlic roller that came with it.  It is a lifesaver!,5.0
13,"I have wanted a garlic press for the longest time since I cook often, and use minced garlic a lot in my meals (I prefer fresh, minced garlic to overpriced, old, and pre-minced garlic).  I purchased this after I saw it was one of the top selling garlic presses on Amazon, the reviews were great, and the price was reasonable.<br /><br />It has changed my cooking experience!!  Let me outline below:<br /><br />___QUALITY___<br />First of all, the quality of this is amazing.  It feels like a $40 appliance, not the $16 I paid for it.  Has a really sturdy feel and nice finish to the metal.  So far I have been using it 4 months, a few times a week, and it still looks the same as when I had bought it.<br /><br />___FUNCTIONALITY___<br />The press itself is easy to use and doesn't leave behind any of the garlic in the press.  You might get a few layers of skin still in the press, but in between each press, it doesn't take long to take out those pesky layers before inserting the next garlic bulb(s).  I can fit maybe 2-3 garlic bulbs in the press each time.<br /><br />The black peeler works great as well -- I recommend chopping off both the ends of each garlic piece before you insert it into the peeler.  Otherwise it doesn't peel as well.<br /><br />___CLEAN UP___<br />If you run the press under warm water immediately after use, you get out all of the remaining garlic juice/skin.  I haven’t had a problem with clean up.  I haven’t cleaned the peeler yet, since to me it doesn’t get dirty enough to warrant cleaning.<br /><br />I have loved this so much that I bought it for my mom for Christmas, and she LOVES it.  She uses it every day, and is astounded by the quality and functionality of it as well.  So impressed with this awesome, inexpensive, but functional and high-quality product!!",5.0
14,This product is fantastic.  I can't even tell you how awesome it works.  I purposely always to buy the real garlic and not the jar stuff but man the hassle and work it took.  Well not with this product.  I am very very happy with it.  This supplier has been absolutely wonderful to make sure I liked it and sent instructions.  I'm tellin ya  Give me more products and suppliers like this.,5.0
15,"I can't believe I didn't find this sooner! I'm not much of a cook – too much multitasking. However, I have recently subscribed to Blue Apron and there are lots of recipes that require mincing, peeling, and chopping garlic.  This process really slowed down my ability to efficiently prepare all the items for each meal. I bought this garlic press recently and tried it yesterday for the first time. OMG! It took a tedious 10+ minute process down to three minutes to skin and mince four garlic cloves.  I had an inexpensive garlic press for years and it was so frustrating to use that I eventually threw it out in favor of manually doing the process – – which really wasn't any better. Clearly, you get what you pay for! And your product is absolutely top drawer!",5.0
16,"Background: Amateur cook, second garlic press<br />I purchased this online and received an email from the makers on how to use the garlic press and silicone sleeve. For the most part, I found this product to be user friendly but I appreciated the email. The product comes in a very nice box. I thought that was great (I am a sucker for nice packaging because it makes me think the makers care) and think it would make a nice housewarming gift. I have used the press a couple of times and found it easy to use. I used the silicone sleeve and found that it does do a good job getting the skin off the garlic. I would give  five stars if it came with a scraper for getting the garlic out. Did fine coming out of the dishwasher. I thought this one did a better job pressing the garlic than my other garlic press (brand unknown).<br />Verdict: This is a great product. Buy it as a gift or for yourself. Will buy again from this company.",4.0
17,So let me say that I LOVE THIS GARLIC PRESS!!!!!!!!! I use to own a Zyliss and I thought I loved it until this one. It is LARGE so you can use more that one clove in it. It is a breeze to clean! and it is easier to squeeze that the Zyliss. Everything  separates so it takes the headache out of cleaning these things. The wholes are large so nothing stays stuck. It doesn't change in appearance after you wash it. It looks just as nice as when I bought it also. This press is sturdy well built and I would highly recommend you buy this press! It is fabulous! It comes in a nice case and has a handy garlic peeler!,5.0
18,"HOW did I live my whole life without this kitchen tool?  I LOVE this!  Great quality, easily cleaned, compact to store.  I've had it now for over six months and I use it a few times each week!  Pull off a clove of garlic, cut off the tough ends, place in press, and bingo, beautifully​ minced fresh garlic.  The paper skin stays behind.  Highest recommendation for this!",5.0
19,"I am very pleased with this well boxed garlic press and peeler set which arrived well before the ETA. The set is so well packaged it would make a lovely present for someone you really care about... including yourself, as I did quite by accident.:)  This is a beautifully designed, quality product. I specifically looked for a press without plastic handles as my last press snapped off at the plastic hinge and all the local shops only seemed to sell presses with plastic handles, the reviews for which were poor  due to the handles breaking off and so I ordered this one after reading a good review about it online. The silicon peeler is a very useful addition and seems to be the only garlic press and peeler set available online - certainly the only one that I came across which persuaded me to purchase it in the first place.  As a garlic lover who uses garlic for both food and medicine, I needed a quality press that would last me a lifetime and I believe this is the one for me. Easy to use and clean, I am very pleased with this set. Customer care has been excellent right from the start and I feel that I have been well looked after both with the product and with after sales care. This business goes the extra mile and I would recommend this set to anyone who is serious about garlic. You will not be disappointed.",5.0
20,"I love this thing.  I don't like to peel garlic before I crush it, and this can handle it with ease.  It has a nice weight to it, and appears very solid.  It is fairly easy to clean.  The peeler thing that comes with it is pretty nifty too, for those times you want whole cloves.<br /><br />The box it came in was a very nice presentation.  This would make a great gift, and will look like you paid a lot more for it.",5.0
21,"Odd as it may seem to claim to love a garlic press, I do.  We've been through several garlic presses at our house.  We've had several that leave as much garlic as a pulpy mass in the press as comes out the business end.  We've had one that worked reasonably well until the handles bent so that it barely worked at all.  This one - a tad pricey, I grant you - actually works and is very sturdy of construction..  As an added bonus, the garlic peeler gizmo is both ingenious and practical.  I highly recommend it.  A must for people who like to cook or who are plagued with vampires.",5.0
22,"This is awesome! It's always been a pain trying to peel garlic, but you just put some cloves in that circular rubber item and roll it back and forth for a minute and voila, perfectly peeled! The crusher is great also. I got this set for my mom and just ordered one for myself. I think I will be getting some for Christmas gifts as well. Really easy to clean too.",5.0
23,"I normally do not purchase 'single use' kitchen tools.  However, this garlic press has changed my mind. You really do not have to peel the garlic before pressing it. Best. Tool. Ever.  I can now fly through my garlic mincing tasks much more quickly than ever.  Be sure to clean the tool out immediately after use, you do not want any garlic stuck in the press.",5.0
24,"&quot;  Everything went fantastic. This family of Amazon sellers are very nice warm concerned people. They really want their buyers to be satisfied and happy and you got to love that. Everyone should own an Alpha Grillers Garlic Press, if you don't buy yourself one of these, it will make your like so much easier and pleasant. I guarantee you will love it, I surely do &quot;",5.0
25,"This is a great product.  It's very strong and sturdy.  You'd really have to work hard to be able to break this thing.  I like that you have the ability to use the garlic press without first having to peel the garlic.  You just put the whole garlic clove in and it peels it for you!  Or if you prefer, the silicone sleeve is included that peels garlic. It works really easily.  This product functions well and is easy to use.  Everything is dishwasher safe, and I haven't had any problems with it in the dishwasher.  It also comes packaged very nicely.",5.0
26,A wonderful garlic press! It is one of those kitchen tools you only subconsciously long for. Many hours have I minced away not knowing the true joy of garlic until now. This is an easy tool to use and easy tool to clean. With the pealed organic garlic (large bag) from Costco what was previously passive resistance is now a driving force in my cuisine.,5.0
27,"If you are looking for a garlic press, then look no further, this one takes the cake...or the garlic. (I know, cheesy). But I have to say I have been extremely happy with this buy.  It comes in a great box and you can tell it's made from quality materials that will last.  I think this would make a great housewarming gift for someone who loves to cook!",5.0
28,"As far as my husband and I are concerned, there is no such thing as too much garlic! But peeling and crushing it was a real pain. It took almost as long to mess with the garlic as it did to chop up everything else. Well, this peeler is the cat's meow! Just roll it on the counter, and you have naked garlic, quick and easy! Now for the garlic press itself...the old press I had was a piece of junk. When it came apart, I was ready for a change.This press is so much easier to use, and much easier to clean than my old one was. And it smashes peeled ginger too! Can you tell, I LOVE this garlic press! Stop ripping your hair out in frustration, and buy this set! You won't regret it!",5.0
29,"I don't really cook with garlic much. However, I do use fresh garlic to make and can dill pickles and they are a pain to peel. the round rubber peeler has literally changed my life lol! It really works slick! I have not used the press yet. But it is very well made. It's says dishwasher safe. It does not fel like a cheesy flimsy product.",5.0
30,This is a very good quality garlic press.  It was so nice to just throw the whole clove of garlic unpeeled into the press and press down cut the garlic away from the bottom remove the peels with the knife and have clean smelling hands.  The customer service is great too.  The first one was damaged in transit and they were very concerned that I was taken care of!!  My daughter is ordering one today.  I would chose this one to give as a gift for sure!!!,5.0
31,"This is a quality product from the case to the included garlic peeler. I was very impressed from the time I first opened it and still am after several uses and cleanings. It its easy to use ... no struggle to press the garlic at all !  Clean it is a snap. I love that the little basket is easily cleanable but stays attached, no lost parts! I love to cook and gadgets like this make it even more fun.  Great Job Alpha Grillers I will be looking to buy more items from you.",5.0
32,"I have been searching for a very strong garlic press that does not waste so much of each clove as the cast metal variety does.  This one is superior in every way.  It is also very easy to clean.  I ordered one to begin with and was so impressed with the way it was made and the fact that it came in presentation-quality packaging.  I ordered several more and gave out as Christmas presents to family members who love fresh garlic as much as I do.  The peeler really does work and can store in a drawer easily as I place the clean and dry peeler on one of the handles.  I don't have to go looking for separate pieces.  I expect to use this combo for several years (the construction is that good).  Thank you, Alpha Grillers for an affordable, wonderful alternative to less-than-desirable old-style tools.  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this very fine product.",5.0
33,This is a beautiful garlic press and peeler.  It comes in a box that is gift worthy.  The peeler is easy to use and quickly peels your cloves of garlic.  In addition the garlic press itself is sturdy and beautiful made.  Since I am trying to eat healthier this new garlic press will definitely come in handy in the kitchen.,5.0
34,Really great garlic press with grate that pivots.  I have bought others before for about $10 and always been disappointed with their quality and frustrated with their functionality.  But this is worth it for the price.  Great quality product and works great.  Always happy to use it  You will not be disappointed.  The garlic skin roller tool that comes with it is icing on the cake and works great.  Very happy with purchase.,5.0
35,"I was impressed before I even received this garlic press!  When my order was shipped Alpha Grillers sent me an Email telling me everything I needed to know about the product so when I got it I already knew what to do.  That was a class act.  Then, when I held it in my hand I could see that it was perfectly designed and I could feel it had some weight to it.  I knew it was definitely a tool that was going to last a long, long  time.  I immediately put four cloves through the press and when I was done pressing I saw that all the garlic had passed through and only a thin sheet of the peel was left in the press.  My wife and I use the press almost every day and couldn't be happier.  We are both in our 70s and appreciate how little effort it takes to squeeze the press. This is by far the best garlic press I have ever owned.  Thanks, Alpha Grillers, for a great product and a great price.<br /><br />PS:  Thanks for the garlic peeler, too.  I had never used one before and couldn't believe how well it worked.",5.0
36,"Alpha grillers garlic press and garlic peeler is a life saver.  I smash the garlic, toss the flies into the peeler. Roll it around and viola! Peeled. Then I put it into the press and fresh garlic in half the time. The garlic press is very heavy metal. How ever it cleans out so easily, as it is in 3 pieces connected.",5.0
37,"This garlic press is the bomb.  The one I had before was cheap plastic & I felt like I would break it every time I pressed down onto a clove.  Not to mention that the screen would always pop off.  Grrr!.  Not with this beast.  I could probably press 30 bulbs worth of cloves through this and my hand still wouldn't be tired.  And the screen is attached!  I figured the garlic peeler wouldn't work, but it really does.  And I haven't had to put it in the dishwasher, I just rinse off any residue.",5.0
38,"This thing is amazing. It really does knock the skin off the cloves easily. I didn't believe it until I tried it. It presses the clove completely in one press. The handle is a bit large and my hands are getting a bit weak in my dotage, so I use both hands, at least with a large clove. I can manage a small clove with one hand, for now.",5.0
39,"Wow, easiest to clean garlic press I have ever bought.  3 part design lets you really open it up, and access the &#34;bucket&#34; with the skin/remains.<br />Also that silicone tube for &#34;rolling&#34; the cloves in to peel...  Actually works pretty well...<br /><br />If you are reading this.  Just buy it!",5.0
40,This is a nice sturdy garlic press. I don't feel like it's gonna break when I'm squeezing more than 1 piece of garlic. It was pretty easy to clean and I like the case it came in. This is the best garlic press I've had and now I'm not trying to mince garlic with a knive. It makes cooking with garlic so much easier.,4.0
41,"Love garlic and love this press.  Packaged nicely, in case you wanted to give it as a gift.  However, this was for me. Includes a rubber tube to roll the garlic in to easily peel it.  The press is very handsome and feels very sturdy in your hand.  Crushing the garlic is easy and clean up is even easier.",5.0
42,Love this! Extremely well packaged - I will be giving this product as a Xmas Stocking Stuffer to all my kids!! My last garlic press lasted 40 years - this one should last longer than that. Both my husband and I were very impressed with the quality of both the product itself and the packaging. Thank you,5.0
43,"Giving this a 5 star just for the rolling garlic peeler thing. I couldn't believe it when I used the roller for the first time. No more crushing the clove with a knife and having to peel it afterward. Such a huge quality of life upgrade!<br /><br />The press itself seems very well made - a nice heavy, steady feeling instrument.",5.0
44,"I just received this garlic press and peeler set in the mail today and have already put it to use. First, I'll start off with the peeler. I put a completely untouched garlic clove in it and used some pressure pushing down on it as I rolled it the first time through. Nothing. Then, I put it back in a pressed harder as I rolled and- wa-lah! A perfectly peeled clove of garlic came out. I guess the trick is to put a good amount of pressure on it when you're rolling and you will know when you're done rolling as you can feel the skin off the garlic coming off in the peeler as you roll. Really nifty device that I never even knew existed, even though it's so minimalistic. (Great if you hate that smell of garlic on your hands all day after peeling with your fingernails- and who doesn't?!) Now, the press. I tried it both with a peeled clove of garlic and an unpeeled clove. The peeled clove came out perfectly, I just scraped the minced garlic from the outside of the press and was done. The unpeeled clove really impressed me as none of the skin came out with the minced garlic and it all stayed inside the inside compartment! I once again scraped off the garlic and simply threw the skin away. What a time saver. Clean up was also a breeze, simply rinsed it real quick and placed it in the dishwasher and that seemed to do the job. Very pleased with this as our old garlic press would always have dried garlic skin on the inside of it to peel out after it came out of the dishwasher. And the packaging can't be beat. Great product, highly recommend.",5.0
45,"This is my first stainless steel garlic press, and I don't know why I put off getting one for so long.  I tried a cheaper one from a local supermarket, but it was awful.  This product, however, is GREAT!  It comes nicely packaged (and after cleaning, I make sure to put it back in the box).  I rinse it right after use, which helps to get the garlic out of the holes, so that there isn't an issue with cleaning it.",5.0
46,"Very nice quality. I bought it to replace a vintage aluminum garlic press which had become a little bent out of shape and required several pressings with stirring of the remaining garlic after each pressing with my old press, with a meager amount of garlic managing to ooze through each time. I ended up mincing the remaining garlic anyway that didn't go through the press, to avoid waste.<br />I held the new Alpha Griller press casually over the bowl and pressed, and was surprised by the force at which the garlic shreds exited the press, shooting over the side of the bowl, totally missing its interior! I've now learned to aim into the bowl.<br />The press was very easy to clean, and I love that it's stainless.<br />I also am delighted by the included garlic peeler. It really works!",5.0
47,"Love my garlic press! Simple to use & easy to clean. I think some reviews are misleading because they say it's hard to clean but it is not hard to clean as long as you do it right after you use it. If you let fresh garlic sit on the press until it dries like cement then yes, it will be hard to clean. You must rinse & clean promptly.",5.0
48,"Love this garlic press! I have had it for over a month now and I use it almost every day and it's still as works as new. This garlic press is great value for money! I personally love using garlic in my food, and I definitely prefer fresh garlic to the ready made garlic pastes you get. This product makes it so easy for me to use fresh garlic. The quality is good with solid construction. I love the sleek, stainless-steel look. The handles are easy to grip; it has good heft but is not too heavy and is very sturdy. It presses the garlic in just one squeeze, hardly takes a moment and not too much force. I've also used it to press ginger with very good results. After using it, I rinse it out under running water for a bit to wash out any garlic (or ginger) residue before throwing it in the dishwasher (with the all steel construction, there is no fear of any melting parts)<br />The silicon peeler is an added attraction. With just the right amount of pressure you can roll the unpeeled garlic in it and it comes out beautifully peeled. Just make sure that the silicon peeler is completely dry before using it.<br />This product comes with a life time warranty and a very friendly customer service, definitely a plus!<br />This duo is a real help in the kitchen!",5.0
49,"A decent product at the price point.  The press itself isn't what I would call high-end, though it was worth the $15.  There's a bit of a gap on the sides of what I'm going to call the plunger (the part that goes inside the grater part) and the basket/grater part.  This leaves the garlic cloves squirting up the sides a bit.  The rivet that everything hinges on does make me wonder how long it will last, but at the price point it really only needs to make it a year or two, in my opinion.  The garlic peeler is awesome and makes you wonder why you spent years peeling garlic the hard way!",4.0
50,"This is the sturdiest and most well made garlic press I have ever had the pleasure of using. It simply feels great to use and clean. As an engineer, I am very impressed with the manufacturing that went into making this garlic press. It is completely made out of stainless steal which gives it a very nice weight to it and gives me the confidence that it will never break. Also, the tolerances used in manufacturing blow my mind and have convinced me to never buy another garlic press. The pieces fit together perfectly. There is no room to spare which makes sure you press all of the garlic without making a mess. Lastly, the garlic peeler is the greatest tool invented for garlic lovers. I bought this set for the garlic press and figured I could throw away the peeler. I was completely mistaken! The peeler makes adding garlic to a meal so much easier. Your hands don't get that annoying sticky all over them and you don't have to either work at peeling your garlic or cleaning the peels out of the press. Lastly, cleaning this garlic press is a breeze. You pretty much just have to run water over it to remove all of the excess garlic. Overall, this is a must buy if you love garlic like me!",5.0
51,"All I can say is how did I ever get along without this for so long? This is the best garlic press, dealer, chopper and anything garlic EVER!  Don't even think about this any longer, BUY IT!  It's AWESOME!  I'm going to get some for people as Christmas gifts. That's all I can say. It really works!",5.0
52,"I use my garlic press on close to a daily bases. My previous one had gotten rusty and was unsafe to use. This one is light weight and does a great job of breaking down the garlic. The rubber silicon tube is great for cleaning out and scraping the fibers loose. It cleans up easily,",5.0
53,"I absolutely love this product! I have used other garlic presses in the past and I wasn't exactly happy with them for various reasons (end result, cleaning, durability, etc.) but this one is just perfect for me. It is super easy to use,to clean and does the job as intended. The peeler is absolutely ingenious!!! I am finally done pilling cloves of garlic by hand, struggling with a knife one way or another. If you have never used a garlic press before, it comes with super detailed instructions and if you are still not sure how to use it or the peeler there is also a short instructional clip [...] . I looked it up mainly because of the peeler part as I was quite sure how it works exactly. I will recommend this product to all my family and friends!",5.0
54,I'd used something like this decades ago but could never find it until now. It works extremely well. The roller peels the garlic clove to perfection. The press feels comfortably hefty in your hand and minces just right. The handles are the right length for grip and pressing. I can't say anything negative about it. If you're an experienced cook/chef or just a garlic lover this is for you. This isn't junk it's quality and should last a very long time. It's a garlic lovers dream come true.Keep in mind that if you've never used something like this give yourself time to learn how to use it. It won't take long. Thank you Alpha Grillers for getting this on Amazon. Contact the seller for instructions on use if you need assistance.,5.0
55,"I don't know what the difference is between this garlic press and the propresser but the pictures look almost exactly the same and this one includes the peeler for basically the same price. The garlic press works extremely well and is head and shoulders above my old one which was too small. This one is very sturdy and has a nice solid feel to it, I can't imagine it will break and it was very easy to clean. I haven't tried to mince ginger yet but by the looks of it I don't see a problem. The most surprising thing about this purchase was the peeler. I was a bit stunned by how well it worked. I thought it was just a gimmicky throw-in but it's not. I've peeled garlic many different ways before but this is by far the best and easiest.<br /><br />The first clove I tried came out smashed similar to what happens when you crush the clove with the flat of the knife and I had to pull parts of the peel out of the clove. The second one came out with about half of the peel still on it, but it was loose and I got it off quickly without any trouble. The third and fourth clove came out without any peel on them at all. So it took just a little practice to figure out how to make it work, but it works unbelievably well. It takes about 3 seconds to roll the clove in the peeler and have it come out completely intact with no peel on it at all. This is by far the easiest and least messy way to peel garlic that I've ever found.<br /><br />This garlic press is a keeper, it works as well as you would expect and it seems to be very solidly built to last. The added garlic peeler however makes this the best buy of them all. If you've never used one of these types of peelers before, trust me, you will be at least slightly amazed.",5.0
56,Yay! Finally a kitchen utensil that works great! This is a nice weight and easily worked with one hand. I love the peeler too as one of my pet peeves is peeling garlic and onions! Easy to clean too which is a bonus! Also cam nicely packaged if you wanted to give it as a gift!,5.0
57,"Fabulous garlic press! Easy to use, easy to clean. The company follows up your purchase with a great informative email on the care and use. It seems to be very well made. I love the garlic &#34;roller.&#34; I was skeptical at first but after using the roller, I love it! Thanks for a great product and great customer service!",5.0
58,"This product does exactly what it claims.  No need to remove the shell of the garlic, the garlic press pushes out the garlic and retains the shell in the press for easy removal.  The roller tube works exactly as it claims as well, if you want to remove the paper shell from the garlic to chop or slice.  The press is extremely well made - very durable and very functional.  I am surprised that Alpha Grillers does not charge more for this product, as well as it is made.  Even the box in which it comes is very impressive!  Note:  I am NOT affiliated with Alpha Grillers in any way.  I paid full purchase price for this product after searching Amazon for a garlic price.  I did NOT receive any compensation or discounts at all for posting this review.  This is my own honest assessment of a fantastic product",5.0
59,"the skin peeler could be better, but overall this thing is pretty nice<br />Once pressed it leaves a thin sheet of what I describe as garlic paper in the bottom, and you still need a knife to scrape off the dingle-berry garlic after the press, but no big deal.<br />Well worth the $ and not having to hand-cut the garlic anymore. My fingers love not smelling of garlic anymore but I'm sure my coworkers hate me as I'm enjoying more garlic in more meals. XD<br /><br />Good heavy-duty feel to it, feels like it'll last a very long time",4.0
60,"Just received it and it came on a beautiful box and I was impressed by the beautiful design. You can tell that it is well made. It works really well, easy cleaning. Overall is a good product and I will recommend  it to my son who is going to school to become a chef or anyone who needs one. It has been one of the best products I had purchased on Amazon.",5.0
61,"A beautiful work of art.  I would proudly display this on my dinner table.  It also does an excellent job of pressing the juice out of my garlic. 😀  I recommend this tool to cooks who love garlic.  The peeler works well, too.  It does require development of technique.  Easy to master with patience.",5.0
62,OMG! This is so much better than the old plastic garlic press I had. This is super easy to get the crushed garlic out. The pieces are just the right size. It is easy to clean and easy to use. The peeler is an added bonus! All in all a great addition to my kitchen.,5.0
63,This garlic press is amazing.  I used to have to chop up all of my garlic and it would make my fingers smell like garlic for a few days.  I hated it.  Now I can just pop in a garlic clove (even with the skin on) and have minced garlic in seconds.  Highly recommend!,5.0
64,"Used the garlic peeler and the press, and they both worked extremely well. Best of all, the press was really easy to clean. Lifted the remains of the garlic skin out of the press with the point of a paring knife and washed it off with hot water. Couldn't have been easier or simpler.",5.0
65,"Very impressed!!!! Seems to be built very, very well built and more importantly does the job of pressing garlic effortlessly. I fully expect this press will last a lifetime and be the last garlic press I'll ever need. Money well spent and a  bargain at the price. You really do get what you pay for sometimes.",5.0
66,"Fast, works well, large, easy to clean.<br /><br />I use either 1 large clove or several smaller cloves at same time.  I don't even bother to peel the garlic.  The press will squeeze out the garlic and leave the peel.  Then just remove the peel and use again.",5.0
67,"Thanks received it very quickly, it is amazing. After my garlic press broke and I went through 3 different types from different supermarkets that were just pure junk (one that cost me $14 didn't even get any of the garlic pressed through!! it just spurted back up the sides and was mashed not crushed) I started looking on the internet. I figured I had already wasted enough time and money and I just want something that works!! but this is more than that and I know will last so that's peace of mind. I never realised how much garlic I use in cooking till I was without one.<br />P.S.  I was pleasantly surprised with the peeler, never thought I would use one of those but it is so simple and effective and very easy to clean.",5.0
68,What a way to have the garlic peeled and then stored for later use.  The mincing is clean and easy of garlic for a variety of dishes.  When I got it I cooked grilled steak with garlic rub and mashed potatoes  with a hint of garlic.  A 5 star dinner thanks to the Alpha Grillers garlic peeler and mincer.,5.0
69,Beautiful and heavy duty garlic press.  When I first opened the box I was amazed at how beautifully it was packaged.  I know that might seem strange but this arrived in a sturdy satin-lined box .  The press is super easy to clean.  I use this almost daily!!,5.0
70,"I would really give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. I does the job, squishes garlic into little tiny pieces. My real issue with this product is that garlic will get caught in sides of the mincing compartment; and have to be dug out. It's a single piece of metal that was bent to get the shape instead of being pressed out of metal. I have to use a finger nail or a toothpick every time I use the press to get garlic out of the fold joint.<br /><br />It's heavy, which I like. Cleans up well with hot water (except for comment above). The &#34;roller&#34; sent to take the paper off of the garlic does actually work. I think this press will last for years to come. (I do miss my old press, but the toddler hid it somewhere months ago and we've never found it.)",4.0
71,"Yeh, it's a garlic press, BUT WHAT AN AMAZING GARLIC PRESS! We had some of the known brands that just don't do the job. I always felt I wasn't getting the most out of the garlic clove I was crushing. We use garlic in lots of recipes, including on grilled corn on the cob. Right from the get go, I loved it. It's sold but not hard to use. It yields the most crushed garlic of the three or four we've had.  A total winner.  The peeler is really nice to have, too.  We keep kosher and are thinking of getting one for dairy and the one we have now is for meat. Now, if it only came in another color, that would take the garlic cake...  A mis too have in any kitchen. Nice job Alpha Grillers.",5.0
72,"Okay, so, used the peeler and press this weekend.... AWESOME!! I peeled much more garlic than I actually needed because it was, for lack of a better word, FUN! I know, sounds silly, but what a cool little idea!! Then I used the press... and pressed all the garlic I needed, and, well, probably double if not 2.5 times what I actually needed because it was so easy and smooth. Don't worry, no garlic was wasted during my entertainment. I'm already thinking there is fettuccine alfredo on deck for this weekend... with some homemade garlic bread. No vampires or werewolves will be within 50 miles, hahahhaha<br /><br />If you are considering this item, I say go for it! Don't waste another minute of your time debating. Easy to use! Easy to clean up! If you like garlic, this is the press for you!! You won't be disappointed!",5.0
73,"We have been using a rather smallish garlic press for the past couple of years. One of the frustrations for me is that, when pressing hard on the handles, you sometimes get pinched as the handles close on the clove. I've also noticed that some of the enameling has chipped - who knows where that goes?<br /><br />So it was time for a new peeler. Enter the Alpha Griller Press and Peeler. What attracted me immediately was the opportunity to get both items with one purchase. The second thing I liked was the look of solid construction for the press. No pinched skin there! I gave the set (which came in a very sturdy box with wonderful graphics) to my wife for Valentine's Day. Upon her opening the box, I was really impressed with the internal packaging as well. Upon picking up the tool, the press feels good in your hands; the action on it is smooth. The peeler is a generous-sized tube.<br /><br />I really appreciated the e-follow up to the purchase as well. I received an email with instructions for the tools as well as a great garlic cookbook with 50 recipes! Both of these were great add-ons to the purchase. This was a great investment.",5.0

78,"Quality garlic press. If you don't have one in your kitchen, just get it already. I promise you wont regret it!!<br /><br />Also, maybe I am a bit slow, but I had a hard time using the peeler lol ended up losing it which really sucks",5.0
79,"I received my Garlic Press and Peeler Set. I have been working on freezing meals for a month and have used the Garlic Press continually on the recipes and they call for minced garlic for the most part.  I used to use minced garlic in a jar, but fresh garlic is soooo much better and the flavor is outstanding.  I just love the garlic press. Yesterday, I decided to use the peeler and was amazed at how easy it was to use and the peelings come off very, very easy.  The one thing I discovered is, make sure the surface you are rolling on is dry, if it is damp, it is harder to roller (no friction).  I just love the set. It would make a perfect gift for anyone.<br /><br />As an added benefit, you get a personal follow-up from the seller on your order. I really appreciated this added touch. I would highly recommend the Garlic Press and Peeler Set to anyone. It is a very good product of high quality and ease of use. Very, very satisfied",5.0
80,"It actually works!!!!<br /><br />The little black cylinder peels garlic quickly and effectively. The press does a great job as well. Pretty easy to clean too. The only caveat (being picky here) is that when cleaning garlic can get a bit stuck on the sides since there is a very fine gap on the seams. That is how the design is made, though, not a defect. I have spent many years looking for a good way to keep my hands away from garlic while still being able to cook with tons of it. Just found it!<br /><br />The package looks pretty good too, could make a nice gift for a foodie.<br /><br />Seller shipped pretty quickly and communicacted very well.",5.0
81,This garlic peeler and press works great! Recently my husband and I have found ourselves using fresh ingredients that we have never really had experience cooking with in a step to become more healthy with our eating habits. The first time we tried to cook with garlic (without the press) it was hard to peel and messy and hard to chop by hand. The garlic peeler made peeling the cloves simple once I got the motion right. The garlic press itself was very easy to use and pretty easy to clean. I would definitely recommend it to someone who was looking for an everyday set. If you have any problems at all the company is very responsive and actually sent an email before I received the product with detailed instructions and also a follow up email to make sure everything was ok!,5.0
82,"Been looking for YEARS for a really garlic press and this is the one.  I have gone through many presses and never quite satisfied with them, doesn't press the garlic very well, hard to clean the screen, etc.  This garlic press minces the ALL of the garlic, from a small clove to multiple cloves, screen it super easy to clean without pieces of garlic left behind to pick out with a toothpick.  I like the garlic peeler to, just roll the cloves in the tube and viola, the clove is clean.  The box the press came in is nice also but unfortunately the press will not be spending much time in it.  Thank you for a wonderful garlic press.",5.0
83,"While I LOVE to use garlic in my cooking, I absolutely HATE peeling and chopping it. I do it anyway because I love garlic so much, but I complain through the entire &#34;ordeal&#34;, especially when the garlic peel sticks to my fingers. Yuck. I've tried other garlic presses over the years but didn't find they were worth the trouble -- they were difficult to clean, had to be hand-washed, and tended to need too much hand strength for me to operate. The other day, however, I came across this model and, after reading the glowing reviews for it, decided to give it a chance. Am I happy I did -- it's a godsend! It works like a charm, it's extremely easy to clean, and -- BEST of all -- no garlic peels stick to my fingers. (In fact, no mess, period!) The silicone peeler is a nice bonus, too, for when I just want to peel garlic cloves for slicing. Needless to say, I am very happy with my new garlic press and highly recommend it to anyone who loves garlic (and hates the mess).",5.0

It works very well and takes little to no effort.  I have purchased many garlic peelers in the past, and this product surpasses them all.  In addition, the seller was wonderful and sent an introductory letter that contained directions for use of both products.  Highly professional service and outstanding products.

94,I already own another garlic press in which the slotted basket is very small. After searching each and every garlic press available on Amazon I decided to buy this Alpha Griller garlic press is because of the size of the slotted basket in which you can fit in more number of pods. I do a lot of Indian cooking and it is going to be a pro in my kitchen. It would be a great idea if this product is made available in India at affordable price.

100,"My Alpha Grillers Garlic Press arrived a few minutes ago. I eagerly tried it out, wanting to see if it really would mince garlic cloves without the skins being removed. I forgot one thing, which the manufacturer warned about: Make sure the press is facing down! I shot a large clove of minced garlic clear across the room! It works beautifully, and only the skins were left inside the press. They were easily removed. I'm so happy that this can go in the dishwasher, but it rinsed clean very easily under the tap. The handles feel good in my hands, unlike other garlic presses I've used. I don't usually buy lots of gadgets, believing that not much can beat a sharp knife and a cutting board, but this was one tool I really think is justified, both by the amount of storage space it will take (which is not much) and by the cost. I look forward to trying this out on ginger, too.",5.0

This saves me SO much time !!! (I use garlic in many dishes – and the more the better).<br />The peeler is also a great time and work saver. Anyone who experimented with peeling little or medium cloves would know what I’m talking about. Even the big cloves can be annoying when they refuse to peel.<br />This is a great set, at a great price.<br />And one last important thing for those who cherish good service - the company provides excellent service – I had a question and they answered without delay, making sure my problem was solved.",5.0

When it got lost, the whole press was useless. Your garlic press is better since all parts are attached to each other. That's really a great solution. Plus, I find that I needed less force to press a clove.

Worked great each time.<br /><br />The chamber is well sized to fit various cloves and peels them without effort it seems. Be careful when you are crushing the garlic as some will come directly out I recommend doing over a plate so it can be used later.<br /><br />Just as the directions say I recommend cleaning it right after use to ensure ease of removing left over garlic.<br /><br />On top of the product working flawlessly the customer service is amazing!

The press itself seems very well built and sturdy.<br />I appriciate the 3 piece design, it really does make cleaning a whole lot easier.  You just open the press and it seperates into 3 pieces, allowing you to easily clean by removing most the nooks and cranies that are hard to clean.<br /><br />Easy to use.<br />Easy to clean.<br /><br />A+ item, glad i purchased it.<br />I will buy more in the future for others.",5.0
111,"I was skeptical at first, like i always am with most things that seem to be too good to be true, but after using it the first time I must say that I am impressed. I stuck a medium size clove in there, squeezed it, and voila I had finely pressed garlic! Worked just like advertised, with all size cloves. The garlic peeler actually worked great too. Again I was skeptical, how could you peel a garlic clove simply by rolling it for a few seconds in it, but sure enough, it works. Try it and you'll see.<br /><br />I was impressed overall with the quality and durability of the press too. Cleaning it is pretty easy as well, just dig out the leftover garlic skin after (which comes right out) pressing, and throw it in the dishwasher or wash quickly by hand.<br /><br />As much as I love using fresh garlic my only regret is that i did not order this a long time ago!",5.0
112,My press arrived earlier today and I am excited to use it! It really is beautifully packaged. I don't think my Christmas or birthday gifts looked this great even when professionally wrapped. I kod. Really though it is packaged like you're going to open the box and find a diamond.<br /><br />The item itself it sturdy and put together well. I punched out several garlic cloves and it minced perfectly. It wasn't difficult to wash since I have a little plastic wire brush for small condiment bottles. It cleaned the press easily.<br /><br />So excited now I don't have to mince garlic on a grater. I've knicked myself too many times. We cook with garlic and ginger almost every day. This will be a time saver.,4.0
113,"I am so glad I got this one. I was going to only give it 4 stars because it's a little hard to clean but then I got awesome customer service inquiries and responses from &#34;Joe&#34;, along with detailed cleaning advice. I kind of scraped at mine with a little knife and stuck it in the dishwasher but all the little bits didn't come off. Now I'm going to stick it in water after I use it and then when I'm putting other stuff in the dishwasher, I can use a little knife and scrape the bits off. Because this thing really works. And I didn't even peel the cloves. I even put kind of too much garlic in my dish since it was so rewarding to squeeze the garlic! Also, it looks like a high-end piece of equipment. I haven't tried the roller thing yet. You'll probably get an email from the company asking how you like it. Normally I don't like these emails cluttering up my in box, but if you really like something or really don't, they can be useful. I think this company really wants to be behind a good product. Thanks, Joe!",5.0

115,"I received mine a few days ago. I absolutely LOVE this garlic press. My hands are not as strong as they used to be. My old press was at times difficult to use; often I would have to have my husband squeeze it for me and nearly half the garlic clove would ooze up around the press plate. More garlic was wasted than useable.<br />This press is extremely easy to use. It is efficient. There is no wasted garlic!  Since there is so little waste, it is extremely easy to clean. I no longer feel that I have to mince my garlic by using a knife. By using the press I get the minced garlic AND the juice that comes with it. I have been able to reduce the amount of fresh garlic I was using while increasing the flavor in my food.<br />The garlic peeler sleeve is very easy to use as well. It didn't take any practice. Just apply pressure and roll. You will be able to hear the crack of the skin. Continue to roll fo a bit and drop out perfectly peeled gloves. Clean up is a breeze.",5.0
116,"I use a LOT of garlic and this makes cooking so easy. cleanup is simple and that is something I really like. The peeler took me a couple of tries because the amount of pressure and amount of rolls varies due to clove size. The press is definitely made for a lifetime of cooking, it is very sturdy and of the highest quality. I am very glad I purchased this item - just love it.",5.0
117,"We are loving the garlic press!  From the moment I opened the box I was impressed with how the press lay on a satiny bed of foam : )  Seriously, we no longer see these loving touches offered in America anymore.  I don't know much about this company, but that tickled me so much I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again : )<br /><br />The press works wonders cutting down our garlic prep to mere seconds from the garlic skin shredder to the easy to use press.  My kids love helping with dinner now - Awesome!  We have only used it for a few weeks, but it appears to be made sturdy with good quality steel.  Again, I am very impressed with them : )",5.0
118,"We received the garlic press earlier than expected.  First of all, its packaging was top notch--it felt like we were purchasing something from Williams Sonoma, minus the huge markup.<br /><br />We have been using the press everyday since, and have been impressed with the solid quality and craftsmanship, as well as how easy it is to push the cloves through, and clean up the press.<br /><br />It is so gratifying to squeeze and have the air filled with the smell of garlic when we are cooking. We can now bid a long overdue goodbye to Costco's crushed garlic in a bottle and powder, which have no essence.",5.0

123,"I was hesitant about purchasing this garlic press without seeing it in a store. But, I decided to purchase it anyway. I'm so glad that it did. This is the best garlic press I've ever owned. It is sturdy, extremely easy to use & clean and leaves little waste of garlic in the press. I also love that it is stainless steel. The peeler is terrific as well. Prior to purchasing this product I had been using pre-peeled garlic because taking the peel off of the garlic was time consuming for me. But, I can save a bit of money now because the peeler is so easy to use that I can once again buy garlic with the peel on. Awesome product!",5.0
124,"Quality heavy duty press and the peeler works better than my last one did. Not as easy to clean as I'd hoped. The type that has the grid cleaner is much easier to use for cleaning. That being said, when pressing, none of the garlic squirts out around the plunger like my last one, so that right there is worth 4 stars alone. Also, you really can put cloves with the skin on in the chamber and it will press them just fine while leaving the skins in the chamber. If you're only doing one or two cloves, this is the way to do it. Any more than 2 and you'll need to remove the skins beforehand.",4.0
125,"First, I absolutely love the ability to quickly (and cleanly) peel the garlic before use. I had never used a tube roller (I thought it was a joke at first) but I mean it when I say that these are a must for peeling garlic. Who knew there was an easier way to peel garlic!<br /><br />Second, the press was not hard to use at all. I had read some reviews on other presses that the press was difficult to use, but I had no issues (and I'm a petite woman, not very strong).<br /><br />Lastly, I also loved how quickly and easily I could clean the press. No more stinky garlic fingers for me!<br /><br />All in all, I'm 100% satisfied with my purchase and absolutely recommend this product.",5.0
126,Using fresh garlic is one of my favorite ingredients when cooking. It is of good quality. The ease of separating the peel from the garlic in using this press is great! Great buy!,5.0
127,Love this press and the nifty clove peeler!<br /><br />I use it almost every night for cooking.  I have minced garlic as well as Lemon Grass and Ginger in it with ease.  I always hand wash it and air dry.  It is a time saver and very useful!,5.0
128,"This thing is awesome!<br /><br />Come in a nice case, which should not matter, but a good touch.<br /><br />The functionality of this press is awesome. With two people we went from 1lb of heads of garlic to all crushed garlic in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />I have had problems with presses rusting before pretty easily. This one has not had that problem yet. Air dry it every time after washing and have had no problems.<br /><br />The bonus sleeve that comes with it is great, just stick in an unpeeled piece of garlic and start rolling with even slight pressure and a few seconds later out pops a perfectly shiny clove. It will take a few cloves to get used to the pressure, but once you do you will love it.",5.0
129,"Ok, I love the garlic press. I mean... it's very nice and I appreciate the easy cleanup. Now can WE TALK ABOUT THIS PEELER?!?! OMG! Where has this thing been all my life? You need to get this set. The end.",5.0
130,"I love the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press and Peeler Set!! I cook with a lot of garlic and have been through many garlic presses that break quickly. This one, however, is strong and sturdy and exactly what I need. I love that I don't have to peel the garlic cloves to press them unless I want to and that I can wash it in the dishwasher. Thank you for a well built, no nonsense, heavy duty, utilitarian garlic press.",5.0
131,"I just had the opportunity to try my Garlic Peeler/Press Set.  Works great.  The Silicone Peeler is indispensible!!  Keep it dry, as when wet it's not nearly as effective at de-nuding a Clove of Garlic.  If needed,  just dry the inside of the tube with a swatch of paper towel, and it will peel the Garlic Skins off in a flash.<br /><br />The Press is robust, and worked as expected.  SMOOSH!!  You just can't beat the taste of Fresh Pressed Garlic.  Easy clean up with a blast of hot tap water, and small kitchen brush.<br /><br />I should have bought this sooner!",5.0
132,"After buying two other presses that were nothing but junk (one of them broke on the first use) this one works perfectly. It crushes the garlic completely and the residue is very easy to clean out. And, the press comes in a real cool box wrapped in a faux satin, along with a rubber tube used to easily remove the skin from the garlic clove. RECOMMENDED HIGHLY. Sturdy chrome steel.",5.0
133,"I got it 4 days and used it twice already.  It seems to work much better<br />than my last one that broke.  It seems to push the garlic through<br />easier.  My last one made out of white metal; I surprised it lasted as<br />long as it did.  This one is stainless steel, so I expect to use it a long<br />long time.  Love the garlic peeler that came with it. Once you know how<br />much pressure to use, it works pretty slick.  The only suggestion I<br />could think of is something my old one had.  On the old one, when you flip the press<br />backwards it had a square of plastic with nobs that would go into the<br />press to help clean it.  Certainly not a deal breaker though.  This one cleans up just fine with the faucet.",5.0
134,"Garlic press and bonus peeler arrived on time and in a very nice box! Would be perfect for a gift! My last press was an OXO brand from Bed Bath & Beyond and it was a step up from my press before that one.  But, holy cow, I wish I'd had this new one my whole life! This heavy duty press is amazing!  Such little waste from the clove to throw away.  I'm amazed every time I use it! And so easy to clean.<br />Anyone looking for a terrific garlic press look no further - you will not be disappointed with this one!  Oh, and the bonus little black tube that is the peeler is wonderful and peels garlic in 3 seconds.",5.0

136,"This kitchen tool is awesome!  I was using the pre-chopped garlic in a jar for the longest time, then a friend brought some fresh garlic over that I used for a dish I was making.  I hand-chopped the garlic, and couldn’t believe the difference in taste the fresh garlic provided.  Not wanting to hand chop the garlic all the time, I decided to buy this product due to the reviews, and I have to say the positive reviews were spot on.  The press uses the whole cloves, and I especially like the rubber roller for quickly and cleanly removing the skin on the cloves.  Clean up of both is extremely easy.  You won't be disappointed at all in this product.",5.0
137,"The company sent me an email containing more information before I even received my package. They have step by step directions, as well as cleaning and storage tips. The garlic press is made of stainless steel and is heavy duty. Definitely great quality! It was very easy to use and clean. The peeler takes some practice (probably due to the fact that I never had used one), but their step by step directions were very helpful! Great product!!",5.0
138,Bought this as a replacement for our box store version we had that the handles broke on. We are very happy with this purchase and how effective it really is in comparison to our last. My wife says it takes a lot less leverage to use and is easier on her hands. We purchased one for our daughter as a Christmas gift for her kitchen.,5.0
139,"I always used the jarred, pre-minced garlic because mincing the fresh stuff by hand took too much time. After signing up for regular meal plan deliveries which include fresh garlic, though, I looked online for a peeler to help me use that garlic up. I chose this press and peeler set because it had the best reviews, and I've been seriously impressed with how easy it is to use--and both tools are dishwasher-safe, too! Just remember that garlic dries and hardens really quickly, so you'll want to scrape out the remaining bits from the mesh before sticking the press in the dishwasher. I'll never go back to pre-minced garlic again!",5.0
140,"I recently purchased this garlic press and so far I love it!  It seems to be solidly constructed and unlike my previous garlic press, it is stainless steel so I can easily scrape pressed garlic off with a knife and not worry about scratching off the surface of the press.  The price is great too!  I checked my local kitchen supply store for options before ordering and this press seems to be a higher quality and definitely a better price!  If you choose this garlic press, I don't think you'll be disappointed!",5.0

I have used another one for years, becoming corroded and difficult to use but this new Alpha Grillers press has a lot of heft to it the old one does not.  It is well-worth the money spent and to have the peeler included is another plus. The fact the press is d/w safe is also a plus to me.  The shipping time was excellent and incidentally, would make a nice gift as it is boxed nicely.",5.0

Really, we don't know how we got by without them. We recently started subscribing to &#34;Blue Apron&#34; delivered meals, and there is a lot of ingredient prep required for each meal, particularly mincing of garlic, shallots and ginger. So far, on the garlic recipes the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press & Peeler Set worked like a champ. From peeling to cleanup, everything about these tools are top notch!<br />Thanks again,<br />Susan and Bruce Landis<br />Eagleville, PA",5.0
144,"This is the best garlic press I have ever owned and I started using fresh garlic way more often than I did before I owned this gadget. It is solid steel and it does not bend when I use it. It is so strong that I have even pressed fresh ginger through the press, but I did not like its' consistency when it came out. I gave it 4 stars because you do have to reach in (sometimes with a knife) to clean some of the garlic out of the cracks, but after that you can just throw it into the dishwasher and be done with it.",4.0

146,I have to say I am very impressed with this garlic press.  I cut the ends off of several cloves of garlic and then used my new peeler to remove the skin. It worked perfectly.  I placed the cloves of garlic in the press one at a time and was amazed how much minced garlic I got from each clove.  The press is apparently very well designed because I was able to press the cloves relatively easily and I don't have a lot of strength in my hands.  I thought the clean up was going to be a mess but it was a breeze.  I used the end of a knife to pull out the thin layer of garlic that was inside the press then held it under running water and all the little bits and pieces washed away with no scrubbing required.  I just added a little dish soap and I was done.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase!,5.0

It is clear a lot of thought went into it and it shows.  Was a bit skeptical about the peeling claim but it really works.  Very happy.<br />I also like the company : got before delivery an email with tips on how to use the press.  This is ofcourse automated, but the tone and content was very balanced (pointing out some possible problems) and personal.  Highly recommended",5.0

I knew I needed to invest in a nice strong one so I went with this one and it definitely stands up to the task because it's made of strong quality metal. As an added bonus, you can put an unpeeled clove in it and it will mince it while removing the peel. AND if you want to peel your cloves (my LEAST favorite task) this one comes with a handy little garlic peeler which peels the skin right off with a quick roll of the wrist. Most similar products don't come with that.",5.0

I didn't even know there was such a thing as a garlic peeler until I searched for a press.  Silly me, I've been smashing my garlic with my knife all these years and then peeling it by hand.

I have eliminated the tedious step of peeling the skin off the cloves, and  this tool presses out every bit of the garlic pulp, leaving only the dry skin behind.  The design of many presses puts undue stress on the product, not to mention on the cook's hands as well.

It was almost impossible to clean thoroughly, but would get moldy if anything was left on it, making me spend so much time cleaning it after each use. So my main goal for getting a new one was for it to be easy to clean. This garlic press was clean in under 5 seconds and I didn't even have to give it any elbow grease. It was so easy, especially with the piece that swivels out. There's no spot I can't get to easily and efficiently.<br /><br />The functionality of the garlic press works great as well. Because of easy access to every part of it, there's no piece left stuck in the press. So you get to use all of your garlic instead of all the little bits going down the drain as you clean it off. I'm so happy with this garlic press.",5.0

I am so glad they did as theirs was the garlic press I really wanted.  It is well made, strong, and presses garlic cloves with little wastage.  It is also easily cleaned.  I have had two other garlic presses by other manufacturers eventually break during the simple process of crushing a garlic clove.  I feel confident this one will last years.",5.0
160,This is just what I needed to make garlic peeling super easy. I tried all the methods from shaking in a mason jar to shaking in bowls but none of them worked. This rubber roller works wonders in peeling the skin off instantly after I cut the ends off.

177,I'm extremely happy with the purchase of my Alpha Grillers garlic press and peeler! It's an answer to the problems I've had with cheap presses that were too small and always clogging up. This press and peeler makes processing garlic for large dishes fast and easy with minimal cleaning time. What also makes this such a great product is the personal attention from Joe at Alpha Grillers to make sure I received the set and was fully satisfied. Thanks for a great product!,5.0
178,"I like to cook with fresh garlic clove. I have been through presses that either break, or do a terrible job. I have used this press two times and I love it because it works great. I would highly recommend purchasing this high quality garlic press from ALPHA GRILLERS. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!",5.0
179,"I love this garlic press, works just as described.  Our previous garlic press was a calpholon and seemed like good construction (it worked decently) but randomly broke one day during ordinary use.  The all-stainless steel construction of this one gives me confidence that it will last a long time.  And it definitly works better than our previous one!<br /><br />Even though we use tons of garlic in our cooking, somehow we never have used a garlic peeler.  I wasn't sure what it was when i arrived, but I've quickly become a huge fan!  It's like magic :).  This is a great product!",5.0
180,"Hi Joe,<br /><br />I promised you a quick review…here it is! Your garlic press is not only of the highest quality, but does an outstanding job of pressing the bulb. The release mechanism cleans easily with just a simple scrape of a knife and leaves very little residue. A quick swish in warm soapy water or once through the dishwasher is all that is needed. I am especially pleased with the flexible sleeve that masterfully discards the outer garlic shell. The first time I used the sleeve, I could instantly tell by sound and feel that the garlic had been peeled; a very nice addition to the already well-priced garlic press. Thanks for making such a nice instrument. Our garlic use has already increased. And btw…we store ours in the nice box it came in.",5.0
181,"Easy to use press and peeler set. Simply slip the unpeeled garlic cloves into the tube, and roll it around on the counter for a few moments. Out pops a clean, peeled clove. Insert the clove into the press, squeeze, and out comes the garlic -- easier to squeeze and more garlic produced than my previous garlic press. Cleans up easily and is dishwasher compatible (the press -- I hand washed the peeler).",5.0

184,"My wife and I really like this peeler and press set so far. We both were able to easily skin garlic in the peeler on first try. We use the peeler if we're going to use multiple cloves, but just press a clove unpeeled if we only need one. The press handles either way just fine. The stainless steel appears to be high quality and cleans up easily. I normally have used garlic powder in place of fresh garlic but will now keep plenty of fresh cloves on hand.",5.0

It comes beautifully packaged and I even received an email from the company and how to use it, clean it, trouble shoot it, and lots of helpful tips.

187,"It's the best garlic press I have ever had. It takes much less strength to press the garlic and I was surprised that I didn't even need to peel the garlic and it still worked really well.

190,"Ordered this to replace a cheap press that flexed a lot when I tried to mash garlic. this press is very solid,  and more importantly,  it's very easy to clean. You put a clove or two in there, smash it, and when you open in the skin is trapped in this mesh or grid of metal that also swings out of the press cup and you can just shake the skins right off, Very easy to use and clean out the left over garlic skins<br /><br />The press is very easy to use,  very strong and easy to clean.",5.0
191,"Works as expected. Take note that the garlic pressed out is a bit mushy, but that might be okay since probably the flavor comes out more. I'm just used to mincing it is all. But this definitely saves a lot of time and gives you a forearm workout. I do say it is somewhat difficult to clean though. I ran it under hot water while picking at it but still didn't remove all the garlic remains. I suggest having a pot of water and rigorously washing it in there. Take note that you may need to use a knife to separate some garlic pieces from the presser as it comes out.",4.0
192,"I gave it four stars is because I did not get response for at least two weeks after complaining the product was lost. The company eventually resent this awesome product, the garlic press. When I need finely chopped garlic for my recipes, all I have to do is get rid of garlic skin, put it in the Garlic Press, press it, and voila. Also, the quality is very good.",4.0
193,"I just received the garlic press and peeler and was very eager to try it. I love it! It works beautifully, and it is so easy to clean. I also tried the peeler and it does such a great job. The press is well made, very sleek looking, and was completely effective when pressing the garlic. It comes packaged in a beautiful box and  it would be perfect as a nice gift for your friends who love to cook. I bought it based upon the reviews and am so glad that is was my choice.",5.0

195,I am delighted with my Alpha Griller garlic press and peeler set. These are quality products that do their jobs well. I'm over 60 and have puny little hands. I've struggled to use garlic presses in the past - I often lost the epic two-handed battles that ensued. The photo provided of the Alpha Griller garlic press on Amazon is deceptive. It actually has longer handles than all other presses I have used. The extra leverage makes all the difference for me - with my &#34;hand&#34;icap!,5.0
196,"Used this for the first time yesterday, my garlic came out perfectly minced! Even though my hands are small, I was able to crush a very large clove with only a bit of effort. Then I just took a small paring knife and peeled away what was left inside, and then swished it in some soapy water, came out very clean. The unit itself feels very substantial, high quality, I expect it will give me many years of service.  Also appreciated the free e-book that was included with my order, haven't made any of the recipes, but looked them over........I definitely will be trying some of them! Thanks Alpha Grillers for a quality product.",5.0
197,"Best garlic press I've used to date. I use a lot of garlic for a home cook.  Just yesterday I used this for 12 cloves and its easy, solid, fairly easy to clean.  I've had this for maybe 5 or 6 months and it holds up well. I clean it in sink to wash out large bits and then often toss it in dishwasher.<br />This would make a good gift for aspiring foodies.",5.0
198,The press is fabulous. I have to honestly say that I was a bit skeptical when I read some of the neg. feedback but since there were more 5 stars than the 1 stars. I gave it a try. i am very glad I did. I will be ordering another one for a wedding present later this year.<br />Besides the impressive packaging. I love how it is made with stainless steel and the handle is nice and heavy! Very easy to use and clean.<br />Definitely a 5 stars from me and I would recommend this tool to anyone who wants a no non-sense and professional-feel garlic press!<br />Oh and the garlic peeler is a wonderful bonus!<br />Thank you for making such fine tool and please keep up the workmanship of the product!,5.0

202,"I've never used a garlic press, so I don't know what to compare it to. The rubber piece does a great job at peeling. The press itself is a little tedious to clean and can kind of get stuck when garlic gets wedged in between the fulcrum. It does a good job though I kind of miss mincing the good old fashioned way. It is certainly convenient, but there's something to be missed about chopping, slicing your own food. 3.5 stars if I could—a close 4.",4.0
203,"This thing is great with garlic.  I don't really know how it does it, but I can put in a full *un-peeled* clove of garlic, squeeze, and only the minced garlic comes out, while the peel stays in.  It's great.<br /><br />I tried it once with ginger, though, and just got ginger juice everywhere, somehow including my face.  I'm hesitant to give it another shot with ginger, so if you're looking for a ginger press, I would look elsewhere.",5.0

I used to avoid using garlic because my old press was so difficult to use and would end up pushing the garlic up the sides of the basket rather than through the small holes.  I'd deduct 1/2 of a star because it's so difficult to clean and I wish they'd include some sort of tool for doing so--however, it works so well that I simply can't take off an entire star!",5.0

But it wasn't until I got the Alpha Grillers press that I realized how much garlicI was missing out on! This one minces so much more of the clove. The peeler was also very cool - I just put in the clove, rolled it back and forth and the whole peel was off!<br />The personal touch from the company via email when I ordered was also nice.",5.0

When I received the set, I tried them both right away.  They both worked great.  The peeler did a wonderful job of peeling the garlic. The peeling of the garlic is sometimes the hardest part.  The press also worked great.  It was very helpful that the company had emailed the instructions ahead.  When the set came I already knew how to use it.  I highly recommend this set.",5.0

I've been buying this &#34;minced garlic&#34; you get in a jar from the grocery store and it just doesn't have the same flavor and potency that fresh garlic delivers. So I decided to get this press because it seemed like it was decent quality at a decent price. I have to say it truly exceeded my expectations. It arrived quickly and in a beautiful box. It's heavy duty, definitely not cheap and flimsy. It feels like this garlic press will honestly last me forever! I'll be cooking with a lot more fresh garlic from now on!",5.0

Everything top notch - the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press, delivery, & packaging. Haven't used the silicone tube roller so can't speak to it's quality.  I'm using the 2nd garlic press I purchased as a stocking stuffer this coming holiday and know he'll be as impressed with this product as I am.",5.0
224,"This thing is great! I was skeptical as to whether it would work, but I have used it for the past 2 days and it works great! The peels stay in the press and the garlic spits out the other end. Sometimes the garlic gets stuck in the grates so you have to peel it off with your fingers, but other than that it is awesome. The smell of freshly pressed garlic is great and now I don't have to buy the prepackaged minced garlic anymore. Fresh garlic smells so much better and is likely healthier.<br />I haven't tried the roller yet, maybe I will update the review once I have a chance to use it.",5.0

No rusting to date (even after keeping it in water overnight) and easy to clean!  Well done Alpha Grillers.,5.0

The peeler allows me to have a whole and uncrushed clove (which I was always used to smashing with my knife in order to peel it). The press is so well constructed and polished nicely that the garlic mush is quite easy to clean out. I may gift this to my parents who may have a crappy press. I highly recommend this.",5.0
271,"The press and peeler set is of outstanding quality. I used both tonight to make a delicious Tuscan white bean soup with garlic toast. The peeler worked amazingly well, allowing me to peel a dozen garlic cloves in minutes. Then I minced the garlic in the press, with ease. The soup was excellent. My guests loved it and I talked about the Alpha Grillers set. Compared to my ancient aluminum press, this one is head and shoulders above.  I also really liked that the seller sent me an online set of recipes. My favorite so far is &#34;Death by Garlic&#34; a simple garlic and olive oil spaghetti.",5.0
272,"This is a nice sturdy garlic press, easily presses cloves of garlic with or without removing peel.  I use the peeler to remove the peel first so I don't waste anything.  It is easy to clean if you rinse it right after use.  The garlic press is nearly identical to the Orblue Propresser which I also bought, cannot tell the difference.  The peeler takes getting used to, makes it much easier to remove the peel..",5.0
273,I love it. Essential tool in the kitchen,5.0
274,"This is a great product! The rolling tube does a really good job getting the skin off, and the press gets about 99% of the garlic clove. That basic one I had made out of zinc coating was a waste. You’ll get your money back from a quality press like this one from the extra garlic you get using this product plus it’s much faster to use and and easier clean. It was actually a bit fun to use for the first time.Like a lot of people say, your fingers don’t smell as much, too.",5.0

277,"Bought this for my Mom, but got to use it myself. It's packaged very attractively with a nice box and satin bag. The press and peeler feel high-quality. Both of them did their job exactly as described; the tube took the peel off in a flash and the press made mincing garlic easy. I pressed an entire head of garlic in no time flat. My mom still prefers peeling and mincing the way she's done her entire life though. I'd take this press any day of the week, though!",5.0

281,"I was in the market for a new garlic press as my other one was not all that easy to clean, much less use as a lot of the garlic would get left in the chamber even after pressing. The Alpha Grillers Garlic Press works GREAT! It's so easy to clean and use--well worth it as a quality appliance that I won't have to replace for years. The peeler works great as well.  All in all, it's a great purchase and I'm happy I found it!",5.0
282,"This is the best garlic press I have ever had and well worth the price.  It easily handles unpeeled cloves extracting all of the garlic and leaving the peel behind.  The peels come out with the point of a knife, then just rinse off.  This is really nice when you have all those little tiny cloves that are hard to peel.  Just add enough of them to equal one decent sized cloves all at once, and press away.  Be sure to point the grate towards your target bowl or you will get a face full of garlic juice.",5.0
283,Just received this garlic press and the peeler sleeve.  This was shipped at the speed of light and I tried it out as soon as I received!  WOW!  The garlic press is amazing.  I have never used a garlic press that was so easy to use and clean.  And the &#34;peeler&#34; sleeve made peeling the garlic cloves quick and easy.  Awesome product.,5.0
284,Works very well.  I like the design.,5.0
285,"I am really enjoying this garlic press. I've had several over the years and this is my favorite by far. There is no need to peel the garlic before pressing and clean up is easy. I just use a knife to remove the garlic skin left in the press, rinse it in warm water and hang it up to dry. It feels well built and expect it to be go-to tool in my kitchen for years to come.",5.0
286,"Terrific product.<br />Simply the best garlic press I have ever used. I have a history of buying them and they always break. This is not at all flimsy and I suspect it will last me a lifetime. Cheap stuff isn't good and good stuff isn't cheap and these are priced beautifully. Would make a lovely gift too as they come in a very pretty, lined box.",5.0
287,The peeler works like a charm. Gone are the days of using a mortar and pestle to break up the garlic in order to peel it. Just need to stick the garlic in the roller and roll it around.<br /><br />The press works great. No need to use a grater to get grated garlic and ginger. Just have to put them into the press. Saves me a lot of time.,5.0
288,"Hey - this thing rocks! Plan and simple, quick and easy. The peeler does an amazing job, and the press gives you tons of fresh garlic in a flash. Cleaning is a breeze. It's a no brainer.<br />Just get it.<br />And what's really cool, as soon as you order it the owner contacts you via email, with a list of instructions.",5.0
289,"Our old garlic press broke and we needed to replace it asap. In our house, having no garlic press is an emergency. I checked on line, and this press was highly rated. So far I am very satisfied. The press is easy to use and easy to clean. It also comes nicely boxed with a message from the company that they have a 100% lifetime money back guarantee. Can't ask for more than that.",5.0
290,"So...this is a game changer.  Allows me to EASILY press garlic while the SKIN IS ON!!  Woo-hoo!  I imagine this works as good as the Rosele one, but it is less than 1/2 the price!  Comes with a garlic peeler as well and a very lovely gift box.  Excellent quality metal.  Highly recommend!  I am going to start giving this as gifts to folks with bad garlic presses.",5.0
291,"What a great and affordable set.  I've used it at least once/day since I got it.  You can really and truly put an unpeeled garlic clove (or two, depending on their size) in the press, and it comes out perfectly minced, with the peel stick in the cage.  No stinky hands!  I love to use fresh garlic because of the taste and health benefits.  This does make it much easier.  The peeler works well also, I just don't need to use it, unless I'm leaving the garlic cloves whole.",5.0

293,"I've used many garlic presses in the past and this is one of the better ones. It's fairly well constructed with solid feel to the handle, which is usually where cheap presses fail. If you are looking to press just a few garlic pieces, just put the garlic in the bin without peeling and it works great.",4.0

Just stick 'em in and press.  It does all it was advertised to do. Much better, actually superior to the Press we have from Cuisinart. Great product to have.",5.0
296,"Wow! I finally used this for the first time this past weekend. I've never had a garlic press, so I have nothing to compare this to, but hand jobs of peeling/chopping/mincing. This bebe rocks, I'm telling you! It comes beautifully packaged, which was much more than I expected, and would make an awesome gift for any cook, especially one who loves to use garlic! So glad I found this garlic press just as I began my search for one, as I can't imagine one finer!",5.0
297,"If you use fresh garlic as much as I do, a good garlic press is a requirement in your kitchen. This one will NOT disappoint. It is easy to use and clean. You can peel your garlic or not ... works equally as well ... but the garlic peeler is great for me (prevents garlic smell all over my hands from peeling!",5.0
298,"Well lets see here, I'm not a big fan of peeling and cutting up garlic so I always end up buying it in a jar.  Although the flavor is good enough, it still doesn't beat fresh garlic.  That being said, I received this product and gave it a go and boy was I not disappointed! I stuffed a couple of cloves into the mincer, squeezed the contraption and voila, no mess, just good ol fashioned garlic goodness!  The best part is that all of the skin is inside of the mincer and it's super easy to remove!  Besides the functionality, the mincer was packaged in a very nice designesque box.  The weight of this product has a very nice premium feel.  I would absolutely recommend this.  This is a small family business so I'm all for supporting them.  kudos Alpha Grillers. :)",5.0
299,"This is a great item. I couldn't believe how effective the garlic peeler is. On simply drops a clove into the black tube, presses down on it and rolls it back and forth for about 2 seconds and it is done. Amazing! The press itself works on the same principle as many others, but it is much more effective in its execution. My former garlic press would let some of the stuff gush out of the seams. This one is made in several different pieces that forces the garlic through the holes. Obviously I am very pleased with this.",5.0
300,"Significantly exceeded our expectations.  Excellent design, materials and construction.  To us it feels like professional level quality and functionality.  Well worth the price.  Quality stainless steel for durability plus long handles which provide high leverage making it easy to use for anyone with arthritis or limited muscle strength.  The peeler works exactly as advertised.  Best Garlic Press we've ever owned.",5.0
301,"Seems skookum, hoping the stainless holds up.  Last press I thought was stainless was zinc cast made to look like stainless.  I'm not particularly fond of the swinging basket.  It doesn't seem to help in the cleaning process in any way.  Maybe the fact it hangs on bottom portion gives it more stress strength when pressing.  Ironically, it seems harder to clean than my last one that had a smaller basket.",4.0
302,"I absolutely love this, this has been such a pleasure to use.  I bought this as an impulse buy, but after using it the first time, this is literally the only thing I use to press my garlic when preparing food.<br /><br />The only negative is that it doesn't do well with very large cloves as the compartment isn't big enough to hold them.  Otherwise, highly recommend it.",5.0
303,"I have used three different types of presses before ordering this one. One got broke, and I returned the other two. Based on the reviews and the price I decided to go ahead and order this one. The shipping was quick and the press is AMAZING. The best quality I ever had. It actually presses the WHOLE clove, something that my other three did not do. Moreover, I received an email from the seller a few days after my purchase. This is a seller who loves what he does and really cares about his products and costumers. Great purchase. Thanks!",5.0
304,"First off, let me say that I am so happy to never have to mince garlic by hand again now that I have this garlic press. The press feels very solid in hand and with the elegant way this device comes packaged, one would think I spent much more than I did on this set. I love that the press is solid stainless steel with no breakable plastic pieces. The garlic peeler tube thing will be a nice asset once I can figure out how to use it properly. This set would make a wonderful gift for any cooking enthusiast who hates the smell of garlic on their fingers as I do.",5.0
305,"This is by far the very best garlic press I have ever owned.  It's beautiful to look at but more importantly it does a terrific job!  It works easily, and the garlic clove doesn't need to be peeled beforehand.  But if you want the garlic peeled first, the peeler makes it easy.  Another huge plus is the ease of clean-up.  A simple rinsing usually removes any residue skin or garlic.  I highly recommend this product! It comes in a beautiful box which will make it a perfect gift for my garlic loving friends.",5.0
306,"This garlic press is awesome. The one I had before was part plastic and it was pretty bad at pressing garlic. This baby is pretty much the Lamborghini of garlic presses. Seriously, it decimates garlic into a fine, aromatic garlic mist. I've never used a better garlic press in my life, nor do I plan to ever use a different one. 10/10, would buy again. Honestly, I may even buy it again just as, like, presents for other people.",5.0

I haven't used the peeler yet, but it does seem to be of decent quality.",4.0

The packaging it comes with shows you from the beginning that this company truly cares about their products and the quality that they put out.

The garlic press is also awesome, it can press huge cloves of garlic, or little ones, both no problem! It is very easy to clean, I just run it under some warm water and make sure there are no pieces and then pat dry. If you clean it immediately like this, it is easy. If you wait, it is more difficult to clean. I am so happy with this garlic press!!",5.0

I had purchased an inexpensive plastic one that I needed 3 times the amount of garlic cloves to produce the same amount of minced garlic that this press does. Plus I had to work much harder at it.

352,It feels a little clunky but it works. The perforated metal is so thin that it does not clog. There is no mechanism that punches out the pulp for cleaning it because it is unnecessary. Rinsing and perhaps a little scrubbing with a brush is enough to clean it if you do it before the garlic dries.,5.0
353,I have used 2 other types of garlic presses and the Alpha Grillers garlic press came closes to how I expected a garlic press to perform!

366,"The peeler is perfect! LOVE IT! Works faster and better than any other method. The press is big enough for sizeable cloves of garlic, but I still have to cut some of the bigger ones in half. Still, it's bigger than most garlic presses, so no complaints on size! The only downside is the press is hard to clean. Wash it right away or you'll have to let it soak and get a good small scrubber to get it clean again. Otherwise it's great.",4.0

379,"I'm very pleased with this garlic press. It's the only one I've ever used, and I'm wondering why I waited so long to try it. It does a great job of mincing and not just making a messy mush. I will say that it's much easier to use on peeled garlic cloves. The peeler works so quickly that I plan on using it first.",5.0
380,"I just don't think there could ever be enough garlic in my Italian dishes. This is a heavy-duty item that works fabulously. It gets rid of the excess peel and minces the garlic in one squeeze. It's real easy to clean with a scrub brush and let air dry. I especially like that this is almost the same thing as other garlic presses that are double and triple the price! Great value, great item, I'm so happy I bought this!",5.0
381,"Excellent garlic press! You really can leave the peels on, but the peeler is also great so you don't get any tiny pieces of skin in the minced garlic. I had first bought an awful garlic press (Garlic Press,WBSEos Stainless Steel Garlic Press Hand Presser Crusher Mincer,Built-in Self-Cleaning Silicone Pushes Cleaner ) and this one is leaps and bounds better!!!",5.0
382,WEDDING GIFT--GREAT,5.0
383,"I used it for the first time today. I love the way it peeled the garlic in the press. I used the garlic in some potato soup. It turned out great. I have always used minced garlic from a jar before , but now I will buy garlic and use this press. It was so easy to use ! and the flavor of the fresh garlic was much better than what I had been getting out of a jar.",5.0
384,Great product.  Clean it up before the garlic dries up in the device. It was left on the counter for a day and was tough to clean out.,5.0
385,"I did quite a bit of comparing as I use garlic and ginger every day.  I put a large piece of peeled ginger and pressed as hard as I could with both hands to test it's quality, half expecting it to break at stress points. Worked perfectly.  Cleaned easily. I thought I'd prefer a flatter handle, but this one is very comfortable.  I don't give 5 stars easily.",5.0
386,I use this a lot for mincing garlic and absolutely love this garlic press. It is extremely well made and quite solid. I never imagined appreciating a garlic press so much but it is honestly the best press by far! I use it very frequently and highly recommend it.,5.0
387,"We thought this was a bit expensive...... but after using it........it's worth every penny......we LOVE<br />this garlic press; the peeler is a very handy tool also.  Cleanup is way easy.  This is a well designed<br />press, that can mince peeled ginger.  Couldn't be happier.  The company is personable and cares.<br /><br />Update: we have had this for a few weeks now.  Still love it. So easy to use and clean up. We can<br />have fresh minced garlic in a couple of minutes.",5.0
388,"This is a nice piece of kitchen equipment. I did not do too well with the peeler ( and I think someone in my household who did not know what it was has thrown it away, since I can't find it anywhere), but the actual garlic press is great. It comes in a nice box, and would be a wonderful gift for someone who loves to cook, or a newlywed.",5.0
389,Too many moving parts. I liked my old aluminum one better but the stainless Alpha model stands up to the dishwasher detergents. I ditch my old model and bought this model for the stainless steel construction.  Rubber peeler is designed for pitching in the trash.,4.0
390,"I highly recommend this garlic press. Easy to use and easy to clean. The peeler tube works perfectly to rid each clove of its shell. I like that the shell remains in the tube while the peeled clove falls out. This makes it a lot easier to manage and clean up instead of having those pieces of shell on the cutting board. The press minces the garlic perfectly. It is very well made, heavy-duty so you know it will last. Great product!",5.0
391,"Great garlic press.  I was looking to buying the Kuhn Rikon model, however the price was more expensive.  Also the Alpha Grillers came with the garlic peeler, which is handy as well.  Would recommend this item as a set.",5.0
392,"I received my garlic press, and I LOVE it!  The garlic press is well made, and beautifully<br />designed, and the garlic peeler works like a charm!  I also really<br />appreciate the attention to detail in the packaging (I am the chair of an<br />art program, so packaging and design means a lot to me).  It says a lot abut the company's attention to detail.<br />Overall:  This is a top quality product, for an incredibly reasonable price!",5.0
393,"I really was impressed with the quality of this product, very nice feel to it and it works great. Probably the best Garlic Press that I owned, been through a few of them. Really can see quality here. Ordered on a Saturday afternoon, delivered with AM USPS Mail Delivery. Also the email from the company was informative, and helpful.",5.0
394,"&#34;This product rocks!!! Best Garlic Press I have ever purchased.&#34; Inexpensive, looks nice, durable and works like a charm. The peeler is awesome and makes getting the most out of the garlic extremely easy.",5.0
395,"Super strong, does the job with a squeeze. I had low expectations for the peeler but that thing works like a charm! I'm done buying minced garlic in a jar.",5.0
396,"I love it. I am a dedicated home cook, rarely eat out and make all my meals from whole foods. A good garlic press is a must. This is my fourth garlic press. It's the only one that doesn't leave a good amount of garlic behind. It's easy to clean, can go in the dishwasher and very durable. I am betting this one is going to be the last garlic press I ever have to buy.",5.0
397,"Just to clarify, I have not used the silicone peeler yet so I will only comment on the garlic press. I believe it is made quite well and comes well packaged. The inner compartment is easy to clean. The seller of this product is probably the most enthusiastic I have encountered yet and appears to genuinely want you to be happy with their product. I also received, as an ebook, recipes that involve garlic (just to let any potential reader know).",5.0
398,"I have extremely weak hands.  I was looking for a garlic press that was super easy to squeeze, that produced evenly minced garlic and that cleaned easily.  This does it all!  What is really cool is that you don't have to peel the garlic.  It automatically takes if off.  In fact, I thought I had peeled the outer layer of the garlic and apparently I didn't do it enough and it finished it for me.  I LOVE this purchase! WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY!",5.0
399,"Very good item and I LOVE the skin peeler it comes with. Works amazing and is easy to clean. Well made, durable item.",5.0
400,"The Garlic Press is awesome and has made adding garlic to dishes so much easier. It's so simple to use, and not having to peel the garlic beforehand is a real time saver. It's very easy to clean, just open up and pop in the dishwasher. As all the pieces stay attached there's no risk of losing parts or having to reassemble.<br />I haven't used the peeler yet but I give it five stars based on just my experience with the press",5.0
401,This is a high quality product and it works very well.  This is a replacement for another garlic press that did not work well at all.  It is always smart to purchase a good quality tool whatever you are doing.,5.0
402,"This garlic press is good. It's sturdy and feels nice in my hand. I like how easy it is to use and how nicely the garlic come out. I haven't tried the peeler yet, but I'm pretty excited to try it.<br />I've used a lot of garlic presses and have to say this it high up on my list. Would recommend",4.0
403,"Great Product! I use Blue Apron frequently and Blue Apron loves garlic in their recipes. I was wasting tons of time cutting it myself until I got this product and it changed everything. Cooking is now easier, faster and the garlic flavors release better.",5.0
404,Received on time.  Was impressed with the weight and construction of the product.  This was the first press that I bought and was happy with the purchase.  Only suggestion I could make is to design a press that we who are old can use.  Am 71 and have a hard time with grip but that's my problem.  I think that you have a great product for the price.  Would strongly recommend it.,5.0
405,No more smelly garlic hands.  The garlic peeler is amazing--I used to hate peeling garlic cloves but that little tube kind of makes peeling garlic fun.,5.0
406,You know what? This is a fantastic product - best garlic press we've ever used. But more than that is the communication and the wonderful after-sales service from the company. I have never experienced such personalised service. Congratulations Joe. We would be happy to buy any product from your company.,5.0
407,Best garlic peeler we've owned so far. Easy to use and so far easy to clean if you do it right away or just let it soak for a bit. Pretty sturdy construction so hopefully this one will last.,5.0
408,Got this for my dad as a Christmas present and he says it's wonderful. He uses garlic often and he says it makes things much easier. I can tell he likes it because when I walked in the house the other day the house was filled with the scent of garlic.,5.0
409,"Great product, solid construction, looks great.  Especially like that the garlic basket is attached on a hinge and not a separate piece to lose. Once you get the hang of it, the peeler works great too.",5.0
410,I recommend this garlic press to everyone. Made from very strong and durable material. Easy to clean and use. The rubber garlic pealer was a surprisingly good tool.,5.0
411,"A garlic press really isn't something one would typically get excited about, but this is indeed a very good one!  Very easy to use with the added bonus of also being able to press ginger as well.  Alpha Grillers is fantastic too - lovely customer service to make sure you are happy with your product.  Highly recommended.",5.0
412,"Love this press!  I had a pampered chef press that turned very gross in the dishwasher that had me wondering what toxins were going into my freshly pressed garlic.  This, with the stainless steel will be a forever hold onto peeler.  I usually smash garlic with the side of a knife so didn't use peeler portion but the press works great.",5.0
413,I absolutely love this product! It saves me so much time & the kids enjoy helping out more with cooking just so they can use this😁 I was using a grater before & I would get more cuts on my hand then grated galic😩 I would recommend this to a friend,5.0
414,I bought this just for the silicone tube to peel my garlic with.  I never really intended to use the garlic press but I got it because the price was the same.  Once I received it I tried the press out just to see and it works so much better then the one that I used to have.  I probably use twice the garlic in my cooking thanks to this set.  I had no idea there was that much difference between presses.,5.0
415,"Works great so far. Like the biggish handles and solid construction. The plastic peeler promptly went into the trash, being worthless to me personally. I usually just use the flat side of a knife to get the skin off the cloves. Good little kitchen tool!",4.0
416,Game changer right here!,5.0
417,"I highly recommend this heavy duty, well-made garlic press. And amazing value for the price.  Easy to use, easy to clean and sold by a great American company.",5.0
418,"Ordered this item from Amazon after having another junk unit fall apart while using, yet it cost as much as this Alpha Grillers Press.  This one arrived in great condition, and looked like a super high end gift the way it was packaged.  But the real pleasure comes when using it.  It performs great and is built very well, this unit should last me for years of pleasurable cooking with pressed garlic!  Thank you Alpha Grillers.",5.0
419,"I received these almost the next day, beautifully packaged and gleaming.<br />They are a well designed and constructed garlic press. Since I use plenty of garlic in my dishes I needed one of this quality since I have had presses break under the strain of repeated uses. This one is perfect.",5.0
420,"Both the press and the peeler work excellently. Saves us a punch of time now as pressing garlic and much faster than chopping. A little bit of garlic always remain after a press, so you have to use a little more. But since each clove of garlic is probably only a few cents, we consider the saved time well worth it",5.0
421,Probably the best garlic press I've ever used. I've tried others similar in appearance and they are much harder to squeeze. Also this one pushes more of the garlic through the holes. A great product!,5.0
422,Easy to clean stainless steel.  Handles are strong so you can press hard.  Wonderful addition to your kitchen if you are not so good with the knives.,5.0
423,"This is a great set, it is functional.  I use the press regularly, I've only used the peeler once, but it worked as well.  My only complaint with this press is that there are two slits where garlic peels/garlic inevitably gets stuck every time and I usually have to run a thin knife along it to poke it out.  Not a big deal really, but it's a design flaw that could have been avoided in my opinion.",4.0
424,Works great. I wish the rivet they used looked stronger.,4.0
425,One of the best garlic peeler and press sets I have bought. The garlic peeler is great at getting all the skin off after about 2 or 3 rolls. And the garlic press gets all the garlic pulp out so there is not much left behind. I am glad I bought these and recommend them to anyone who is looking for a quality garlic press.,5.0
426,I had to buy a second garlic press because my son liked my first one so much that he took it back to NY with him.  He uses his all of the time and I love mine and find it to be a big time saver and a Hugh help in mincing garlic.  A great buy!,5.0
427,Good product and good company.  Really liked they way they communicate extra instructions thru an extra email.  Especially for the peeler.  Excellent product.  The peeler and the press have both worked quite well.  Pleased with this purchase.,4.0
428,"The garlic peeler works if you only need to peel one or two cloves.<br />If you need to peel more, it's best to drop them in a sealed container and shake it until the skin falls off. Or go old-school and slice off the root-part of the clove and peel off the skin.<br /><br />Great Press altogether",5.0
429,"Now that I know how to use this puppy, I can't stop. It's SO easy. I still peel the clove manually, but that doesn't bother me. The only downside is after pressing and getting the garlic out, there's some leftover that can get stuck when trying to wash and clean.",4.0
430,"We just received our garlic press and love how solid it is and how easy it works!  This press feels like it will last a long time. It's much easier and cleaner than using a chopper.  We were pleasantly surprised at how well the garlic peeler works, too!  We didn't expect that would be something we would really use, but it peels all of your cloves at once, so I suspect we will use it every time now :)",5.0
431,"I have wanted a garlic press for awhile and was not impressed by the quality of others.  This is a very high quality press, easy to use and fits great with my storage.  Love it!!  So glad I waited to find a high quality press at a fantastic price!!",5.0
432,"works well , quality made product",5.0
433,"Very high quality stainless steel garlic press. Operation is quite simple, you just pop a couple of cloves into the chamber and press. You don't even have to peel the skin off but I would recommend doing so before operating. It just makes cleanup much easier. I have not come across any cloves that do not fit into the chamber yet - would recommend",4.0
434,"My husband purchased the Garlic Press and Peeler set for me last week. We tried it out and loved it. We were amazed how perfectly the peel comes off of the garlic. It was kinda fun! The Garlic Press was amazing too. It was easy to use, worked great and cleaned up with ease. No more stinky garlic hands when chopping garlic by hand.",5.0
435,"The quality of this garlic press is top notch! Works great, looks impressive, and appears to be built to last a lifetime. Also, the silicone tube roller works better than I expected. Wish I had purchased this years ago. Plus, it comes packaged in a box worthy of a first-class gift and rivals the packaging you would see with an Apple product. Great find!",5.0
436,"Excellent product  I would buy it again, and recommend it to anyone looking for Garlic Press And Peeler especially for this price",5.0
437,The press is very well built and sturdy. It works flawlessly as does the peeler. I am also very pleased with Alpha Grillers. They were thoughtful enough to email the instructions and helpful tips without even being asked. Bravo! Thank you.,5.0
438,"My daughter loves this garlic press (isn't it nice when children get old enough to get excited about receiving kitchen gadgets?). When I opened the box, I was impressed with how sturdy and well-made it is, and simple compared to others out there that have all kinds of flip-this-way and flip-that-way sections (drives the husband a bit bonkers). Very pleased with this it'll-last-forever purchase! Really nice seller, too. :-)",5.0
439,Best garlic press I've ever owned! So easy I went out and bought a big bag of garlic at the discount store!!!,5.0
440,Good quality.,5.0
441,This peeler works like magic. It is very easy to use and is so much nicer than trying to peel by hand.  The press is great too.  The garlic gets pushed through the press instead of escaping back past the part that is supposed to push it through the holes.  It is easy to clean as well.  I love it.  It works much better than my old one.,5.0
442,"Very well made; it is substantial and does a great job on garlic cloves. Almost all of the material is squeezed through to press. The addition of the peeler tube is great. Just pop a clove in the tube, puta little pressure on it, and roll it on the counter under your palm.<br /><br />A real quality product well worth the price.",5.0
443,"Fifteen years ago I bought a Henkel and thought it was the greatest, but the separate sieves kept falling into the garbage disposal. This design solves that problem and has the highest rating from Cooking Illustrated. It is high quality all stainless steel and looks like it will last a long time. Received it in 3 days free shipping with 3 other items from amazon prime. It performs like all the positive reviews say.",5.0
444,Well I typically don't give 5 stars to things as there are some improvements required but this is a great tool and does what it says. I always says Garlic is one food which you enjoy as you grow and now I like Garlic in all my processing. This press makes enjoying Garlic and OXO has done a great job. highly recommended.,5.0
445,"This is the third &#34;Garlic Press&#34; I've bought in as many years.  The first two were junk - this one is a dream come true.  It works exactly as it says, and exactly as you would expect it to.  Can't tell you how happy I am with this purchase.  I've been sick of chopping my garlic with a Chef's knife for years, and I put garlic in everything.  This thing is sooo perfect.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could...",5.0
446,"Very solid construction. the way it open up makes it easier to clean, but cleaning a garlic press is no fun no matter what.  The case is a nice touch, but a bit too frilly for actual use (who wants a velvet lined case in their kitchen?). The little silicone peeler tube is fantastic!",5.0
447,"Wonderful, sorry I waited so long to get 1 !!!",5.0
448,Easy to use and does a great job on pressing the garlic. It's a little annoying to clean with the swinging &#34;tray&#34; but over all it's lightyears ahead of my old garlic press (that recently busted after 4 years of use). I anticipate this one should last!,5.0
449,"This garlic press works very well, is easy to clean, and shows no sign of rusting. It is very sturdy, and the peeler sleeve is easy to use and rinses clean. It was a great buy, and the company seems to care about its products and customer feedback. We will be getting some of these as gifts for friends, it comes packaged in a nice box.",5.0
450,So far I love it! I have used it twice and was impressed with how much of the garlic came out. I was skeptical since I've been through a LOT of garlic presses. The other I bought for my mother for Mother's Day since she is always saying she can't find a good garlic press. I hope she like it too.,5.0
451,So far so good. The press works perfectly and lives up to the numerous positive reviews. I think we will be crushing a lot of garlic this summer because of the ease of use of the press. Clean up is simple too. Glad we invested in this tool. And Kudos to Alpha Grillers for following up. Nice to know they are a small family run business and that they care about customers.,5.0
452,Love It !,5.0
453,"Received my press today and put it right to use. It outperformed my expectations. I was skeptical about not having to peel the cloves prior to pressing them, but it worked great and peeling the skin and remains wasn't hard at all.",5.0
454,Got this for my elderly mom because she was sick of her old one that hurt her hands. Doesn't require much hand strength to use and cleaning up isn't as bad as her old garlic press.,5.0
455,"Everything is exactly as expected, even better!  This is undoubtedly the best garlic press I have seen (others worked poorly and lasted no time).<br />The recipes provided with it are also excellent.  Definitely would buy from this seller again.",5.0
456,I found this easy enough to use but the garlic does shoot out if you don't hold the press close to your bowl.  Some residue slides up the sides of the press.  Tad messy but given that I have poor grip strength it's easy to squeeze.,4.0
457,This garlic press works perfectly. It gives plenty of leverage to crush the garlic. It cleans easily and it is rock solid. It works better than the other name brand garlic press that I already own. I would not want to be without this garlic press.,5.0
458,Works great and the seller is very interested in there customers satisfaction,5.0
459,"Fantastic! Better than the Bed,Bath and B....product at slightly better price. This tool seems to increase the amount of crushed garlic as compared to the two other presses I used before the Alpha Griller. So good, I find myself looking for opportunities to use this press. I wonder what garlic would taste like on breakfast cereal? But this press. You won't be disappointed.",5.0
460,"Both works exceptionally, these guys know how to craft their products!",5.0
461,"The elaborate casing was overkill since the product didn't need any additional frill.  It works great as is.  It's easy to clean and it's obviously made well of strong, heavy material.  It presses both garlic and ginger well.  The peeler was a nice touch.  It's such a simple concept, yet brilliant at the same time.",5.0
462,This product is excellent! I have bought two different garlic presses elsewhere to try and replace my old one and they were junk. This works like a dream and is fairly easy to clean. Just pop the mesh part away and run under water. Dishwasher does the rest. I was also impressed at how easily the garlic peeled. Alpha Grillers packaging was very nice and well done. THANKS!,5.0
463,"This garlic press is wonderful.  I put four cloves in it, and it pressed out every bit of garlic.  My old garlic press didn't do that at all.  I highly recommend this. Oh, and the garlic peeler was an added bonus.  I've used it twice so far and it gets all of the peeling off.",5.0
464,"fast, accurate delivery. Product works very well at mincing the garlic and at separating the interior and exterior of the clove. Really glad we bought this product. Had one we used for many years but it didn't work nearly as well as this one.",5.0
465,"I bought the press along with the garlic peeler tube as a package.  The garlic press works very well, and is easy to clean.  It is also very durable and made of stainless steel.  When done, just place it in the dishwasher for easy cleaning  The garlic peeler tube works great too, and peels garlic cloves with ease.  It is also dishwasher safe.",5.0
466,"Excellent for garlic. However, I am elderly with small hands. There is not enough leverage for me to use it with ginger which is much denser to crush. It is a quality product though I still have to chop ginger with a knife.",4.0
467,Great product.,5.0
468,This is an amazing press. I know some female reviewers have said it was to large for their hand. I'm 5'6&#34; quite an average hand size and I have no problem at all! I blew through 10 cloves of garlic in minutes. Also using it for ginger is just as easy. I did use a potato peeler on the ginger before using the press. It came out perfect. I highly recommend this product!,5.0
469,Delighted with this garlic press! It looks great and is a satisfying weight in your hand. A little pressure on the handle is all that is needed to produced finely squeezed garlic. Cleaning is a cinch too with the three part head design! Love it.,5.0
470,"I've been through several garlic pressed in my time, and this one is the best.  Cleaning isn't quite as easy as my previous one, but it's a close nit to pick.  I'm getting more garlic out of every press and the hopper holds larger pieces.  To my surprise, the peeler actually works.",5.0

477,"This press is great! Our garlic consumption increased over several weeks, and I was really tired of mincing garlic. While it didn't take a long time, I'm not the most patient prep-cook. This press gave fresh, minced garlic in about 2 seconds! The press is easy to use and clean (less than a minute if you clean it right away after pressing), and it's a fabulous price. I highly recommend it!!",5.0

The press is high quality stainless steel and the handles are comfortable and strong. It really smashes the cloves easily and so thoroughly that nothing is left but the thinnest unusable fibers. No wasted garlic.,5.0
482,The press works great! Super easy to use and seems to be of high quality. I was tired of messing around with cheap ones that I always ended up throwing away after the (failed)first use. I love this thing because I have big hands and mincing garlic is a pain. Haven't tried using the peeler yet.,5.0

489,"I would actually give it a 4.5 because it is hard to press, but for doing a fantastic job, easy clean... fantastic. Bought another that simply was more trouble than doing them by hand (and generally I like to do garlic by hand but sometimes I feel stiff or want it fast). This may be the end of me doing them ever by hand. Sturdy, great job, highly recommend!",5.0
490,"I love the garlic peeler (black rubber sleeve pictured} and the press itself is quite nice. Hefty as in has weight, sturdy.. going to really have to try hard in order to damage it, like drop it in a lake or run over it with a tank.......... Very high quality... Presse ginger nicely as well...",5.0
491,This is an excellent product for an excellent price.  Delivery was fast.<br />Packaging was nice and elegant.  Warranty seems to be on par with<br />The quality of  the product build.  This is basically the only garlic press you will<br />Ever need.  I wish I bought this one the first time around!,5.0
492,"the rubber peeler is amazing!  The press works well, but it requires you to clean out the inside every few cloves and washing it at the end is a bit difficult since garlic gets stuck in a lot of the cracks",4.0
493,Love gadgets that make cooking easier for me.,5.0
494,Works exactly like it should.  It presses the garlic and leaves the peel.  I didn't try the peeler so I can't review that.  I normally don't need to slice garlic only press it.  Alpha Grillers contacted me to make sure that I rec'd it and was pleased with it also.  They seem to care about their customers.,5.0
495,"I was able to use the garlic press for the first time tonight and I loved it! The best part is how easily the grates clean up. I used to have to go and clean up my OXO one with a toothpick, pricking each individual hole to get the garlic remnants out. What a pain in the butt. Love how easy it is to use your peeler! Thank you for making a quality product!",5.0
496,"So far I love this press and peeler set. I use it mostly for larger recipes. With small single servings I just use a knife. These tools make peeling and mincing so much easier for larger batches of peso, sauces, etc. I use garlic daily, therefore this tool comes in very handy when needed. Fast delivery too!",5.0
497,"Great press, easy to clean, very nice stainless steel. Looks like it will last forever. Bonus garlic peeler. To me Alpha Grillers  is #1. Not made of cheap Zinc. Try it, the company stands behind it.",5.0
498,"I love these things! Between the peeler and the press I am saving so much time and I no longer have smelly hands! I do still use the peeler before I put the cloves in the press, its not necessary but I feel like I get more out of the press if there's less skin/peel in the way. Buy this, you won't be sorry!",5.0
499,"Great product as other reviews have stated, arrived faster than expected, and was exactly what I was expecting. Good quality stainless steel, and feels good in your hand. The garlic peeler is also very nice and handy. I would definitely recommend this set. And it comes in a nice silk cloth.",5.0
500,"Forget the cheap pot metal garlic press at the grocery store, get this instead. Everything about it has been better than expected. Delivered on a Sunday, I open the box to see this solid and amazing press on a sheet of soft fabric. Great design, and comes with a nice tube to pull the paper off the garlic. Only a few bucks more than the cheapo grocery store model I had just broke.",5.0
501,"Amazing product and really functional as described. Joe, the owner of Alpha Grillers, actually reached out to us personally when our item had a delivery issue, and sent us a new garlic press and peeler. He was always available to speak with us. We have really enjoyed using this peeler, it's durable and has enough room for large to small garlic gloves. Highly recommend!!",5.0
502,"It works as intended and is a well built solid piece. However, my only fault of this press is the garlic will sometimes get stuck along the inner edges when pressed. It's quite annoying to clean, but I will continue to use it. It's just that darn convenient.",4.0
503,"Really nice product. The garlic press works as you would expect and is well made. The surprise is the peeler, it is simple yet remarkable to use. These folks want your business and do a good job showing it. From the order verification to following up to see if everything arrived on time, they are concerned and helpful.",5.0
504,"This heavy garlic press works well, but you'll need a knife to scrape off the minced garlic. The only complaint I have is that the receptacle is too small, accommodating only one large unpeeled California garlic clove at a time from the bag I buy at Costco. Cleaning the press also takes times and care.",4.0

506,I used to buy pre-chopped garlic in the oil from the store until I found this but the garlic doesn't taste right from the jar.  I love the garlic peeler as much as the press.  I use this every night for cooking.  I would buy this as a present for anyone who cooks.,5.0

516,"This garlic press in great! It's made of quality materials and is built to last.  There is little to no waste, the garlic is almost 100% minced with just one squeeze.  This unit is replacing a fancy looking bur poorly performing plastic model with a steel blade.No comparison.  Absolutely worth the extra money!",5.0
517,"One of the best garlic presses I've ever owned. Before I purchased this garlic press I was frustrated as heck because every one I would buy would bend, break, or be tough to clean.

No regrets or complaints.",5.0
519,"Best garlic press we have found.  Use it almost daily, and it is holding up great.  We have tried several others, and all have broken within a few months.  By all appearance, this has much better construction, and we have less waste than any other brand we have used.  Would highly recommend to anyone.",5.0
520,This was my first garlic press purchase ever and I don't know what I've been waiting for!  It works so well and so easily! It also came in a really impressive/nice packaging and feels very sturdy.  My guess is that I'll be using this for a long time to come!,5.0
521,I love love love love this product! Did I say love? The little black tube roller works so well and it's so easy to peel garlic that I find myself using it every night! I always hated to peel garlic and wouldn't because it was too time consuming. Not anymore! Oh yea... the garlic press is pretty impressive too. I would definitely recommend this item.,5.0
522,"I just received this and not only is it solid and well-constructed, it does a great job with crushing garlic. I had a generic garlic press, nothing special, and I was amazed at the difference in how thoroughly this press worked and left behind almost nothing but the thinnest bit of peel.",5.0
523,I don't know why I waited so long to buy a garlic press. It's much easier (and safer) using this press and peeler instead of my usual smash the clove with the side of the knife to peel then chop.,5.0
524,"I received this Garlic Press and Peeler for Christmas this year 2014. I was a bit skeptical but after using it several times, I'm really impressed with this product.

532,My beloved garlic press that I've had for years broke on me so I went to the store and bought another and hated it. Then I took to Amazon to find another and this is the best garlic press I've ever used! Would definitely recommend!,5.0
533,"I was extremely pleasantly surprised with the top-notch quality of this product down to every detail including the packaging making it a great gift idea.<br /><br />I am finally released from the slavery of having to use garlic powder. I would rarely use fresh garlic in the past because it was so tedious to peel and chop, but with the peeler and press, it couldn't be easier.",5.0
534,Just what I needed. Solid construction so this will last the distance. Easy to clean and takes big cloves well. Already whipping up garlicky mash. A good investment for my kitchen,5.0
535,Works great and came in a nice box.  I had never used a peeler before but that also works well. I'm actually writing the review because the store included a nice note asking for a review if I was satisfied. I am.

542,Great.  I love the peeler!,5.0
543,"Does a fine job crushing the garlic. As others have noted, if you load this up with a big clove the handles are very far apart and it may become a 2-hand job. Personally, I would have liked it to have a mechanism to clear the holes and basket of garlic skin too. It would have been a nice touch to have on this otherwise fine tool.",4.0
544,"I've gone through many garlic presses that either break, don't work, or are to hard to clean.  This one is very strong.  This is not a &#34;bend not break&#34; type of metal; this is a &#34;crush the living snot out every clove.&#34;  This will probably be on the xmas list for family.",5.0
545,This press is amazing. I had bough a similarly priced press at Walmart and it was complete junk. This thing wastes no garlic and cleaning is a breeze. The peeler works as described for larger cloves but not as well on smaller pieces but it still makes life 99% easier so I can't complain.,5.0
546,"I use the garlic press to crush/mince several spices.  My only complaint is that it could be easier to clean.  The container were the garlic cloves go has crevices where pieces of food can hide. Other than that, it's a nice design.",4.0

549,"I am very pleased with this garlic press that came with the peeler which does a great job. I use garlic on a regular basis - at least couple times a week.

564,"Got to use the new garlic press tonight and I love it.  It works very well.  I wasn't smart enough to try the peeler, too, but I will the next time I use garlic.

580,"I've only used it a few times, but it's the first garlic press that's crushed almost the entire clove. Normally I have about a quarter of a clove of garlic to scrape out. Also love that it's dishwasher safe. Feels really sturdy, and my last good one (OXO good grips) broke, so I'm obviously tough on them. Haven't yet tried the peeler.",5.0
581,Smashed the garlic to smithereens as advertised but it takes extra effort to clean. You have to be using at least 6-7 cloves to make it worthwhile using this gadget.,5.0
582,"Amazing! I didn't realize this was how garlic presses were supposed to work!  In all of my previously grocery store-bought garlic presses, I've wasted about 1/4 to 1/2 of the garlic clove. When I pressed my first clove with this, I was amazed to find out how much garlic actually came out the bottom. I was even more amazed when I opened the press to find essentially nothing inside... no half-squeezed remnant to scrape out, and no garlic mush squeezing around the sides of the press. Because of this, and the way the screen moves independently of either handle, it was super easy to clean up. Overall it has a very solid feel.<br /><br />I looked at a couple of presses on Amazon before buying this one, and what got me was the peeler. It takes a little but of practice to get the right pressure and motion, but once you've got it down, it makes peeling the garlic MUCH simpler. One important thing is to make sure the clove is not wet, or it'll just slide around inside. Though still workable, this also includes the little bit of condensation that can develop when I take cold garlic cloves out of the refrigerator (I live in humid Houston). I just let it sit out of the refrigerator for a few min before I try to peel it.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this press!",5.0

615,This is probably my 5th garlic press and it's outstanding to say the least. It really crushes the clove and you get the maximum amount out of every bit of garlic you put into it. It's easy to clean and It's built like a tank. I don't think I'll ever have to get another garlic press in my lifetime. The company deserves a lot of credit for their customer service attitude and informational emails and packaging. They even sent me a nice coupon for a sizable discount for their superior meat thermometer (which I got immediately and love it). Buy this press and don't look back.,5.0
616,"Absolutely THE BEST garlic press I've ever used.  Strong, Sturdy and won't bend under pressure.  You can't go wrong purchasing this!  I'll most likely purchase more for Xmas gifts!",5.0
617,Amazing!!!,5.0
618,Items arrived on time and work great! The peeler is very effective and the press works perfectly.  Our old press allowed half of the garlic to squish up around the plunger but this one does not do that. All of the inside of the clove comes out the holes and the skin stays inside the press as advertised.,5.0
619,Exactly what we needed! Quality product at a great price.,5.0
620,Very high quality for the price!,5.0
621,Received on time and product was as described by manufacturer. Packaging was great as it comes in a very nice box. Press is high quality and has substance to it. Works very well. Pleased with purchase.,5.0
622,"Love this set, I can not stand the smell of garlic on my finger!! This is a super help for FRESH minced garlic. Deliver was fast and the presentation of the box was beautiful.  Will purchase more as hostess gifts this Christmas!",5.0
623,This opener is strong enough to open my food cans of both large and small.  It grips the edge and cuts a clean cut around the sides.  It did not have a problem with the cans with deep grooves and did not slip.,5.0
624,Now I know what I was missing out on.. You get all the juices extracted perfectly and more enhanced flavor by using this garlic press.. the peeler is great too. Nice set. I am going to buy my daughter one.,5.0
625,I really think the peeler and press are wonderful! They are both way ahead of what I had been using. The press does a great job and was much easier on my hands. I highly recommend this set.<br />Very satisfied shopper,5.0

631,"Great press and peal remover. My wife said it feels harder to squeeze than her other press, but we are getting way more garlic per clove. Very solid and well designed.",5.0
632,"I was looking for a sturdy, high quality garlic press to replace a broken OXO one (stainless but with plastic insert). This one does the job perfectly! The added garlic peeler is a bonus - who knew that peeling a garlic bulb could be SO much easier! Nicely packaged if you wanted to gift this to a friend,",5.0
633,"My old garlic press was an OXO Good Grips press that is still available for sale here on Amazon (for about sixteen doll hairs).  I was pretty happy with the OXO model but it was getting worn/corroded and some of the plastic ""pusher"" cleaning nubs had broken off.<br /><br />So I read reviews on garlic presses and decided to try this one.  So far this one works awesome!  The business end is all stainless steel so I don't think it will have the corrosion problems that my OXO press had.  The best thing about it is that it seems to extract almost double the amount of garlic out of a garlic clove as compared to my old one.<br /><br />This one seems easier to clean too as the garlic doesn't get stuck in the holes like my old one did.  I just take a knife end and pull out the remaining skin/pieces and then throw the press in the dishwasher.  In my opinion this one is definitely better in every way than the OXO model and it has held up great so far...<br /><br />Oh...I almost forgot... You get a silicone garlic clove peeler with this press too.  These work great and are easy to use and clean, but I already had two in my kitchen.",5.0
634,Very satisfied with this garlic press. The design and final finish is very stylish and sturdy. Very easy to clean and use. The deliver was right on the dot.  I will definitely will purchase again from this vendor.,5.0

637,Unbelievable quality at a low price !!!!  The peeler is amazing!  Saves a tremendous amount of time if you're doing a fair number of cloves.  The press itself looks like it's the highest quality made .... and it probably is !!!!!  Absolutely the easiest press I've ever used ..... effortless !!!!!!!,5.0
638,A far superior product to the ones I have tried to use in the past.  It came in a really nice box that made me think it would be nice to give as a gift.,5.0

649,This is a great product and very well made. The design of the press makes it easy to push the garlic through. The press is easy to clean and all the parts are connected and swivel around the toe of the press. The peeler works great.,5.0
650,"This product works wonderfully, exactly as it should.  The handles are far enough apart so they don't hit each other when pressed together which allows the crush to push all the garlic cloves through the strainer on one squeeze.",5.0

662,"I like everything about this garlic press. It works like a charm, and cleans easily either by hand or in the dishwasher. The peeler is large enough for those bigger cloves.

663,"I've only used the Press and Peeler a few times since purchasing, but I am very imPRESSED (ha!).  The quality seems top notch, the material seems very sturdy, and the price was very fair.

718,"By far the best garlic press I have every owned.  I went through three cheap ones from the local supermarket over the last couple of years, and the last one breaking down after just a few uses with a thin piece of metal simply bending out of shape.<br /><br />No question about it, this garlic press is of a superior quality, and I expect it will last.  I think I could break it, if I wanted to, but having used it half a dozen times, and put as much pressure as I would ever use on it, I don't see that happening.<br /><br />I would take off one star for three minor issues, given that this is a premium product;<br /><br />1. The press chamber is quite small.  There is no reason it can't be made somewhat bigger.<br />2. Not too easy to clean - it would be nice if the design was altered to allow access right to the little holes when cleaning. Alternatively including a small plastic piece that is shaped to poke through the holes, would work too.<br />3. Design tolerances should be tighter, to prevent the garlic from being pressed out of the press chamber but not through the intended holes.<br /><br />Now all of that said, while I would take off a star, I can't help but appreciate the nice little garlic peeler.  I was astonished that it works, and works quite well to make peeling garlic much faster.  Just a few rolls of a clove, with moderate pressure, and the skin literally falls off.<br /><br />Overall it's definitely a product I would recommend to any serious cook.",5.0
719,I have already used this product a few times since I received it and it has been great! Chopping/mincing are one of my least favorite parts about cooking. This product makes my life so much easier. It's very easy to use and clean and it minces garlic in perfect tiny cubes.,5.0

834,"This garlic press is awesome! It works well and is easy to use. I have not used the black silicon piece yet in 5 months because I don't see the point. I just press everything. It probably works fine, I just haven't needed to use it. Sometimes I use the point of a sharp knife to get small pieces out of the holes in the press, but overall it cleans well. I put it in the dishwasher and it comes out clean and shiny but sometimes with small threads of garlic that I just pull off. When my first one came in the mail, the box was broken and there was something sticky on the press (maybe a sticker or something was on it). When I wrote the company about it, their customer service was exceptional and they sent me a new one right away. I believe it only took a day or two to receive it. My experience with Alpha Grillers was wonderful and their product is great. I just wish they made more products!",5.0

856,"Works great, exactly like you would want it to.",5.0
857,Nice build quality and works well.  We replaced a garlic press made by Pampered Chef that the handle snapped on when I pressed a large garlic clove.  This unit handled a ton or garlic without a problem!,5.0
858,"The Best Garlic Press on the Market.<br />A very practical design forged with high quality stainless steel make this garlic press the best on the market. The flat surface of the prodder forces the garlic through the holes quickly and efficiently. The hopper size will also handle more than one piece of large garlic. Unlike others that use pins as part of the prodder, this unit, with its flat surface, leaves little residual garlic in the press. Being a fanatic for kitchen tools, I have bought just about every type of garlic press on the market, and most do not meet the standard for two reasons. Usually the handles are made of pot metal or some other weak material, and they simply do not hold up. Others that also are also made of high quality materials use the pin type prodder which just makes a big mess and does not press the garlic through the holes efficiently. The Alpha Grillers has another special feature--it has a sliding cleanout. After pressing the garlic, you slide the cleanout in order to get the small amounts of garlic remaining in the press. I have not seen this feature on any other garlic press. I bought 3 units just in case. Do not hesitate to buy this press. You will definitely not be disappointed.",5.0
859,"Awesome design, easy to handle plus it includes a garlic peeler which I need to have one as well!",5.0
860,I bought this for my mom. She said its easy to used and no more mortar and pestle for her again.,5.0

865,I was a little skeptical about the peeler but it really does work! Makes cooking a bit easier and faster. Would totally recommend!,5.0
866,"I have to admit, I seldom use fresh garlic, and it's because I'm too lazy to mess with mincing it up.<br />It's sticky, stinky, and pieces fly everywhere while I'm chopping.<br />Always thought of getting a press, never owned one before, so I have nothing to compare this one to.<br /><br />I do like this press a lot. I like the way it's constructed, and it's easy to clean.<br />Minimal pressure is needed.<br />Havent used the tube peeler yet, I'm a little skeptical of that, and there is a bit of pulp left in the strainer<br />after pressing which does not always flush out with running water. It gets stuck in the corners. So it use a toothpick<br />to remove it.<br /><br />Very handy, well made devise, and it's not very expensive.",5.0
867,Works great.  Best I've used.  Seems durable.,5.0
868,Love this thing!! Works wonderfully! Highly recommend!,5.0
869,This is a  very good garlic press. It obliterates the garlic and nothing is wasted. It's very sturdy and it feels very well constructed not like all the other cheap versions you get out there. I'm surprised at the price for such a good quality press. I love garlic but hardly cook with it because of the pain it is to peel and chop. I peeled a whole head of garlic in minutes. I'm still working on the technique for the rolling peeler. Not too successful with that.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />3/8/2016<br />Still using my garlic press and it is in pristine condition. I gave one to my sister for Christmas and she was thrilled!  I thought it would be a lame present. Who gives a garlic peeler for Christmas? But what do you know? She was in the market for one. Her old one was disentegrating. It only lasted her 20 years. LOL. So I'm sure one the Alpha Grillers will last her another 20.,5.0

959,"After using this product for about a month now, I must say it is a good quality product. The grips gives you a good torque leverage to crush garlic and it's quite easy to clean. I found that if you squeeze the grips in one steady pace (in one motion), the garlic gets a nice crush with even pieces. I have read some negative reviews of this item.  Dear people I am sure the founder of Alpha Grilles,  that is &#34;Joe&#34; i, is not going to produce an inferior quality product to sell to us. There is no product made in this whole world that is 100% perfect to suit everyone. We all have different product expectations and not any product will suit everyone. So dear people let us give &#34; Joe&#34; some encouraging feedback on how this item works. Let's it be constructive so that they can use this information to make the product work better for us. My suggestion to Alpha Grillers. ..can your product designers make the &#34; hopper&#34; a little more bigger, maybe horizontally with the handles adding more torque, so that bigger garlic cloves can be put in for a bigger crush. In all, I like this product. It handles well, easy to clean and is made of good quality. Thank you Joe and all the best to your team at Alpha Grillers.<br />Howard.",5.0

1158,I don't know what I did before this peeler! And the mincer works great too!,5.0
1159,"I really liked this set of press and peeler. There is why:<br />The press minced all the garlic. Only thin skin and crushed garlic inside of the holes left. The peeler loosened the outer skin of the clove without damaging the clove.<br />All the parts of the tool are perfectly aligned: nothing loose, nothing too tight.<br />The press came out of the dishwasher shining like new. So it is dishwasher safe. Although remember not to put anything made of aluminum together with this press to DW because aluminum will react to the acid in DW gel and the stainless steel will be stained. Reviews about OXO press say that after dishwasher soapy water was dripping out of the handle. Nothing drips out of the handles of this press.<br />The press feels durable yet luxury.<br />I was also pleased with the box the mincer came in. It was perfectly smooth, with silky cushion. It reminded me the box of $750 watch which I had a chance to hold once.<br />Yes, I recommend this set.",5.0

1210,"Before buying this product from Alpha Grillers, I was really frustrated with the two less expensive presses I purchased locally.They were hard to use and produced very little garlic - actually, the thing they did best was make a mess and cause me frustration.  I had abandoned the idea of investing in another press but I was cooking a special meal that required quite a bit of garlic so I jumped on Amazon to see if there were any presses worthy of consideration. Alpha Grillers got great write-ups for both product and service, so I decided to give it a try. Received this product last week and have used it 5 times since then. It is the best crafted, most effective press I have ever seen or used - even better than the one used in my professional cooking class!  With this press, I get every drop of garlic from the clove - quickly and easily. Clean up is a breeze. AND, it comes in a beautiful case with a note that says they are committed to your satisfaction - which I actually believe. I know I sound like a paid commercial for them - but I'm honestly just a very happy customer.  Check out the reviews - there are plenty of us. If you're in the market for a great garlic press, don't hesitate to purchase from Alpha Grillers. You will absolutely NOT be disappointed.",5.0

1278,"I am so glad I decided to purchase this garlic press set.  The press set comes in a beautiful, sturdy box with much pomp and satin lining but is a very nice press, certainly deserving of such presentation.  It is beautiful  and heavy and seems to be very well made and certainly did a very good job squeezing the cloves into a beautiful mince just as I wanted them.  I am very pleased with the purchase.  The press itself feels good and weighty in the hand and is very easy to use and clean.  The peeler was sort of fun.  You don't really need to peel the cloves to use the press, but it was an interesting experiment in clove rolling.  I've only peeled cloves by hand in the past so it was sort of a treat to give it a try.  The bigger cloves came out great whereas the smaller, more dry cloves still needed a bit of work to get free of their paper after rolling them around in there, but it could also be the skills of the newbie, first time user.  If I wasn't pretty sure this press will last me the rest of my life, I'd definitely buy it again.",5.0

1288,"LUV it!!!<br />This press  works so great with NON-peeled garlic I am amazed.  Does your press spray garlic out from the top and sides causing a mess and loss of garlic?  Then wait no longer...order this one...you will not be disappointed.<br />Second best feature is clean up which is quick and easy.  Even the skin removes easily and intact so with a rinse and little swipe of your favorite dish pad it's ready to dry and put away.<br />Presentation is adorable: in a cloth lined box like a small treasure to keep forever - and I plan to.  No more stinky garlic fingers, no more struggling to peel the skin.<br /><br />They have designed a great product that does the job to my 100% satisfaction and an excellent price to boot.

1294,"I researched long and hard after having a third garlic press fall apart.  The time between presses was painful!  This is a must-have product in the kitchen.  I like this model because it doesn't have any plastic pieces which seemed to be the defective part of the others.  It does a much better job of crushing the garlic and it does so with ease.  I remember struggling with my last one and getting my husband to take over.  I don't have that problem with this one.  Also, the garlic peeler is effective and useful.  The only downfall is that it's not easy to clean but I figured out that if I lie it facing flat/downwards in my dishwasher it comes pretty clean.  This was a problem with all of my  previous garlic presses and so I'm fine with it.  It comes nestled in it's own black-velvet covered box which is oddly nice for a kitchen utensil.  I've got the box in the kitchen drawer because i couldn't bring myself to throw it out!  It would make a nice gift.",5.0

I will buy this press again without a second look at others since I had now used it.<br />Great job! and thanks for making my life a bit easier and a lot easier for the peeling of the cloves .",5.0

This one earned the right to be in my kitchen. I haven't used it yet but I'll update you on that. Nevertheless, I'm recommending this press to anyone.",5.0

1340,"This is my 2nd garlic press, so I can only compare it to the prior one that I owned & literally wore out. This thing kicks butt, so much easier to use. Two design features make this noticeably better than the previous press I used:<br /><br />1. All metal construction. Crushes garlic without much force.<br /><br />2. The two handles have an air space between them when fully closed, which prevents your palm from getting pinched.<br /><br />It has more moving parts and is therefore a little harder to clean than my old one, but face it: nothing easy about cleaning up a garlic press regardless of the design, so I don't detract a star for this.<br /><br />I haven't used the peeler, so I can't comment.",5.0
1341,"This is a garlic game changer. over the years I have gone through countless other brands, and none of them come close to comparing. First off, the peeler is magic, you put the full unpeeled garlic in - roll for 15 seconds, and voila! peeled garlic! Then, there is the press itself- it can fit a larger amount of garlic than most presses, its very well made, no flimsy oxo press here! and best of all IT DOESN'T RUST which has been an issue I have had with every single other press I have ever had. Both press and peeler are dishwasher safe, and have probably been run through mine 50-80 times now in the past year and still look as good as new.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the cost? underpriced. I would have happily paid double.",5.0
1342,"I would give this six stars if I could.  This is by far the best garlic press I've ever owned.  It's very sturdy; easy to handle; gets a lot of leverage, so it doesn't require a great deal of effort to use; and because the garlic chamber is independent of the body of the press, it's very easy to clean.  Best of all, you don't have to peel the garlic.<br />Also, the owner personally sent me an e-mail a few days after shipment to ask if I was satisfied with the press and had any questions.<br />Excellent gift for under $20.",5.0
1343,"A garlic peeler and press that really works. Who' d have thunk it? A company that actually sent me easy-to-follow instructions that worked to a T. All stainless steel construction that I didn't have to use The Hulk's strength to use. (Thank goodness! I have had arthritus since I was very young) It made an onerous chore fairly pleasant and my garlic bread was delish. The garlic in the jar just doesn't cut it, not as sweet. I would buy this again, as a gift because this is a well made product that looks like it WILL last a long time. By the way, it is packaged in a very nice presentation box. Nice for a shower/wedding, housewarming, birthday, etc. gift.",5.0
1344,"5 Stars on everything. My package arrived a day early and I got an email from the seller to verify delivery. I'm 60 years old and have owned a few garlic presses but none like this. It is truly the perfect package. The peeler pulls the skin off effortlessly and the press is great as well, no garlic squeezing out the sides like my old one. It's one piece sturdy stainless steel, meaning the grid piece is attached so no losing it in the dishwasher or utensil drawer. I couldn't have made a better choice. Oh, and the price gets 5 stars too!",5.0
1345,"Let me explain why I love this product.<br /><br />Even though the press works well with regular cloves, I prefer them peeled. The silicon sleeve is terrific- gets that skin off with no effort.<br /><br />The press is nicely engineered and looks very expensive. I hung it next to the stove for ease of grabbing it as I cook. Stainless steel, lifetime warranty, ease of use, wonderful results, quick clean up.<br /><br />Everything about the press is so top-notch, I bought two more for my sisters as gifts. I'm sure they'll love it, too!!",5.0
1346,"I got the Garlic Press & Peeler quickly<br />Yes, all was good with the product<br />Yes, I am using it all the time<br />Yes, I love it<br />Yes, it saves me lots of time<br />Yes, it works great<br />Yes, it is easy to clean out and clean up<br />Yes, I have stopped giving away garlic and am keeping it all to myself to use now<br />Yes, my house smells like garlic now and so do I probably!<br />Yes, I have told my friends about it<br />Yes, they want one too!<br />The only thing I would suggest is that it can be a little hard to squeeze the handles together on large cloves since I have small hands. Can you do anything about that so I don't have to cut them first?",5.0
1347,"I didn't know what to think until I received this garlic press. It is truly impressive. It is very easy to use, and takes very little strength. Clean up is a snap and only takes a few seconds under the sink sprayer. I also like the garlic peeler that's included. I have an older one which is wider in diameter, but this one seems to work much better. I have another garlic press which is made in Taiwan. I used to think that that one was great. But this one beats it hands-down!",5.0
1348,This set went way above what I was anticipating. The peeler is fantastic- just place a few garlic cloves in and roll it on a counter with your hand and 20 second later you just have to remove the peels. The press does exactly what it is supposed to do but is also VERY easy to clean. The press comes in several different layers so they can be washed individually and you don't have to worry about anything getting missed.,5.0
1349,"I don't really like uni-taskers in the kitchen but both of these work as expected. The press does what you'd expect. Use it over the pot/pan etc. though do the juice is not lost. Cleaning is not a pain but not simple either. The peeler, wow! I really had low expectations but it really works as long as it's dry. Not great at the tiny cloves but the big ones take a moment to peel.",5.0
1350,"First - When I received the set, I was very impressed with the packaging - I could have given it as a gift without changing a thing.  Next - the press works very well - and easily holds larger cloves.  Clean up isn't an issue - the residue from the press can easily be removed with your finger or, if needed, the point of a knife.  Haven't used the peeler yet, but can't imagine there will be any issue with that.  Very happy with my purchase.",5.0
1351,"Best garlic press I have ever owned.  My previous garlic presses were OXO, both of which snapped under pressure after years of use.  I decided to upgrade to this Alpha Grillers press, and I'm so glad I did.  Sturdy, simple, easy. I love everything about it:  the ease of use, the capacity of the chamber, the look of the product, the feel of the grips, the weight of it, the easy clean up, the box it comes in.  It's a solid product.  I've only had it for a week, but I'm very happy with it and will buy a couple more for wedding gifts.",5.0
1352,"Overall, very good product. Easy to clean.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars is the fact that product is made in China which is not necessary a reason for worse quality, but more because I didn't find that information on Amazon, under product description.<br />Silicone tube roller works great but the problem comes when the rubber inside becomes slippery, and that's usually after you remove 4-5 skins from cloves.",4.0
1353,"I have had many garlic presses over the years. The Zylis Susi, KitchenAid, Oxo, Progressive and some others. I pretty much stuck with the Susi as I found it did the best job. However they seem to lose their coating quickly and you're left with some nasty black garlic bits. And while lab tests show it's not really harmful it's just darn unappetizing. So I thought I'd give this new press a try. It is 18/10 stainless steel so I won't have to worry about the dishwasher or having some sort of coating flake off into my food. Plus the price was great. I was surprised when it arrived. What a wonderful package presentation. Great graphics on the box and inside was the press all gleaming and in a silk lined bed. I'm sure the silk is fake but it looked good. This would make an excellent gift for anyone.The press itself works great and cleans easily and it gets all the garlic from the peel, unlike the Oxo which leaves about a good 1/8 inch of garlic behind. I've been cooking for over 40 years and this is an awesome product well worth twice the price.",5.0

1368,"This garlic press is sturdy and easy to use. It crushes garlic cloves without requiring you to exert a lot of pressure with your hand. It comes with an amazing little device -- nothing more than a tube of vinyl-like material -- that peels the garlic coves when you put them inside the tube and roll it across the counter top. Another plus is that the press is very easy to clean, as it has an inner piece that pops out and can go in the dishwasher.<br /><br />The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the price seems high to me. However, I will also say that ALL garlic presses are high priced. When I was checking various brands and prices online, I saw some that were as high as $75!! There are some much cheaper ones, but they are made of zinc, which breaks and can taint the garlic. Perhaps garlic presses in general are more complex than I realize and thus more expensive, but nevertheless, seems odd to me that the price points for stainless steel presses are so high.",99

1371,"The garlic peeler in this set is worth the money alone. I worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years and love to cook. A lot of restaurants buy bulk garlic that has already been peeled, but if you want to make a lot of your own minced garlic it's a pain to peel the amount needed to do so. The garlic press is way better than most of the ones you'll find at your local department stores. The handles don't trap water like a lot of them do and the chamber where the garlic is pressed rotates so it's easier to pick and rinse out what couldn't be pressed. Other presses have the chamber where it can be completely removable so it can possibly get lost. Most are completely fixed and the press doesn't open wide enough so it's hard to clean out the chamber. 5 stars for a 5 star product.",5.0

It comes in a box lined with taffeta or something like that.  It's looks like royalty in a box, if you can imagine a garlic press arriving that way.  This company cares about presentation.  They are probably CEO chefs.<br /><br />Update: Jan 4, 2016<br />I've used this press several times since my first review.  And I need to add, this is one of the best products I have ever purchased: period.  It works great with garlic and whole ginger root.  It's actually a pleasure to use it because it works so well.  This is the perfect gift to give to a friend, neighbor, or loved one.  There doesn't actually have to be a special occasion, although it would make a great wedding gift.",5.0
1381,"I bought this press due to my frustration with trying to keep my old school press clean, it always seemed like I could dice the garlic by hand faster than cleaning the old press.  And it never seemed to get really clean, there were always a few holes plugged no matter what I did.<br /><br />This one holds more, squishes easily and is a relative breeze to clean.  I just swab it out and toss it in the dishwasher and it's all good.<br /><br />It comes in a fancy box too, I don't care about that personally but it would make for a cute gift.<br /><br />Overall a good product that I would recommend.",5.0
1382,"I have just purchased my second Alpha Grillers Garlic Press; this one for a friend.  I have owned a few presses in my time but this one, hands down is the best.  Here are my reasons: #1 it is stainless so it doesn't smell like garlic after you wash it.  #2 clean up is super easy - either hand wash or throw it in the dishwasher - just be sure to pick out the garlic skins first.  #3 it's actually comfortable to press - my last press had &#34;square'ish&#34; edges on the handle and I never realized how much I was struggling with it until I purchased this version.  #4 it's worth every penny!  In my opinion it is a great value and the rubber peeler that comes with it is quite useful. #5 The Seller is great!  He contacts you to let you know your order is coming, sends separate directions on how to care for the press and then reaches back out after you have received it to ensure you're 100% satisfied.  I know this isn't unique, but it is still appreciated, and above and beyond what many Sellers will do.<br /><br />Trust me, if I didn't love it, I wouldn't have bought a second one :-)",5.0
1383,"This is a great garlic press. I cook meals on a daily basis, and I use a LOT of freshly minced garlic. This press is sturdy, and fits multiple cloves into the reservoir for pressing. The only feature of this product that I do not love is that the garlic sometimes gets stuck in the press. This makes it difficult to clean the press, but eventually will come clean with a little bit of TLC. Still, I highly recommend this product.",5.0
1384,"I have owned many garlic presses, and I think this is an excellent tool.  I find it does an excellent job and is easy to clean. It requires very little pressure to press a couple of peeled cloves.  I like the company guarantee for life.  The garlic peeler tool accessory is a nice inclusion because it allows you to peel the garlic by rolling it and this could come in handy if you want perfect, peeled cloves.  Usually I just press the clove with the side of a knife and quickly peel it, but the peeler is good for two reasons--the garlic clove is whole and you do not pick up the scent of garlic on your hands.  Raw garlic is pungent, and the oils will be absorbed into your skin, along with the odor, unless you wear gloves. A garlic press is a very fast way to mince garlic and  the peeler does help if you want to use a whole clove, slice the garlic or chop it.  I am happy with the set.",5.0
1385,"This is one of those products that makes you wonder why you waited so long to buy one. Maybe you just never bought one after moving out of your parents house or maybe yours broke at some point along the way and you just never replaced it. But it's amazing!<br /><br />It's very simple to use. The peeler can consistently peel about 2 cloves at a time. The press really varies on how much you can do at one time - I've been able to fit 1-3 cloves at a time. Both pieces are very easy to clean.<br /><br />Overall, I really love how much easier this product makes my life. Definitely recommend for everyone from the occasional garlic eater to the home chef who uses garlic several times a week!",5.0
1386,"Alpha Grillers sent this to us to try and I gotta say it's a huge hit at our place!<br /><br />From the moment we opened it up we were really impressed. It's packaged in a really nice box and inside the box just shows off the awesomeness of the press & peeler. Class act packaging!<br /><br />How It Performs:<br />============<br />Peeler<br />- By far this was my wifes favorite part of this combo. You stick a garlic clove in the rubber peeler, roll it around and out comes your garlic clove all peeled and ready to use. The wife has tried it several times now and really, really loves using it! Before she said peeling garlic was a total pain in the rear. If you get this just for the garlic peeler it's totally worth it!<br /><br />Press:<br />The press is really cool. It's a 3 part press. Two handles and the press cup. After you've peeled your garlic clove you put the clove into the press cup and press away. It evenly presses the garlic into fine garlic pieces that are perfect for adding right into recipes.<br /><br />Clean up:<br />The press is all stainless steel (that I could tell anyway) so a quick rinse in the sink or a turn through the dishwasher and this thing is spotless!<br /><br />The rubber peeler also is really easy to clean up too. Just run it under water to get the dried garlic off and you're set.<br /><br />Overall:<br />The wife REALLY loves this! In the middle of reviewing it, we moved and after the move it was one of the first utensils she asked about (&#34;now where did you put that garlic press?&#34;) Yep. She likes it that much! It makes really quick work of peeling garlic and mincing it in the press is a breeze.<br /><br />If you're sick & tired of peeling garlic cloves the &#34;old fashioned way&#34; or if you'd like a really nice press for garlic, you've gotta give this one a try!",5.0
1387,"Great press.  I bought mine in July 2014 when it was listed as a &#34;launch&#34; product.  Now, nearly 3 years later it is still as sturdy as the day I bought it.  I was concerned with it being a launch product that I could be buying some inferior product that would bend or break in a short period of time but that has not been the case.  This is a great tool and I'd recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel there should be some way to make the handles a little more ergonomic besides having two straight steel handles.  With that aside: works great, very sturdy, still shiny, with only a few minor scratches - as should be expected after 3 years of use.",4.0
1388,"Love garlic? Wanna spoil yourself? Look no further.....IT'S THE ALPHA GRILLERS GARLIC PRESS!!!<br />Seriously, I LOVE cooking with garlic, but it's a pain in the a$$ mincing this shiz up small enough that my family doesn't complain about &#34;biting a BIG piece of garlic&#34;. Like, HELLO! I just slaved over diner and the thanks I get is a complaint about the size of the garlic! But enough about my ungrateful family.....<br />This gadget really does make life simpler. The silicone garlic peeler is a DREAM!!! A DREAM I tell you!! Just pop off a few pieces of garlic from the mother head, slip them in the tube, roll with a smidge of pressure, and VIOLA perfectly peeled garlic! If you like to preserve fresh garlic by canning, you're going to slap yourself with joy when you use the peeler! It somehow, magically peels the garlic pieces and leaves them blemish free! I almost feel bad pressing the garlic because the clove is so beautiful.<br />TO THE PRESSER!! This MoFo is the sh!t. I'm LIVING for this press!!! Could it be any easier????! Pop a piece of garlic in it, squeeze it to death, and in seconds you have little pieces of heaven that even the pickiest, feistiest, most ungrateful eater can't find!<br />Worth every freaking penny!",5.0
1389,"This new Alpha Grillers  Garlic Press and peeler set ,really gets the job done right. The packaging is very nice and would be great for a culinary gift. It will make a great addition, to your cooking arsenal.  The quality,heavy duty  18/10 stainless steel construction,  means it will last, for a very long life time, of use.This press is dishwasher safe. The garlic peeler is high quality durable silicone. This makes it very easy to add garlic, to all of your favorite dishes ,with ease. After using in my kitchen for a while I really feel that this product is a great value and has merit, in any kitchen. That is why I give this product a very high recommendation for, lifetime guarantee, quality materials ,in construction,ease of use and clean up,and overall usefulness . I hope this review is informative and useful to readers .",5.0
1390,"As a novice cook I thoroughly researched garlic presses before settling on this one.  I was prepared to buy one that was twice this amount but am so glad I got this one by Alpha Grillers.  It is exactly as advertised, stainless steel and feels hefty to the touch.  The hopper is large enough to crush garlic and can also be crushed with the skin intact.  My only issue, which I think is the nature of garlic itself, is that after each press I have to clear the hopper of garlic film regardless of whether the garlic is already peeled or not.  It's not a big deal and clean up is a cinch.  My mother was so impressed that I am getting her one as well.  Great product all around!",5.0
1391,"This press/mincer is everything I could want in one. It’s weighty and comfortable to use. It’s easy to clean. It has little hanging loops at the end of the handles. AND it does it’s job perfectly on the first go, every time. You can press peeled or unpeeled garlic cloves without the skin coming through.It’s made out of solid stainless steel and comes in a well designed box on a little satin cushion. It took a few days for me to finally talk myself into “disturbing” it from it’s perfect little presentation bed. Silly, I know, but I’m a sucker for good presentation. But this quality adds it to my list of “Good Wedding Presents” as well as “House Warming Goodies.”<br /><br />The peeler is purely a bonus, but a nice one. I won’t lie, I had to Google how to use one. It’s stunningly simple. You pop however many cloves you want into the silicone tube and then you role it on the counter for a few seconds. Ta-DA! out come the skins and perfectly cleaned garlic cloves. This will be a good way for my toddler to be able to help in the kitchen as he gets a little bigger. No possible harm to be done. I’ve already used it a number of times and can see myself continuing to do so.<br /><br />A wonderful set, and I expect it to hold up for many years",4.0
1392,"Excellent Tool For Garlic Lovers<br />We eat lots of garlic, and when my press broke (LOTS of garlic) I ordered this one. It's very good. It's also very heavy. That's information some people may need. The hopper is large and can take multiple cloves. The little garlic peeler is rather useless for me. I just slam the garlic w/ my chef's knife and the skin's pop off. But it might help some people. The only thing I'd really change would be putting a &#34;self-cleaning&#34; side on it, something my last one had. Hard to explain, but they do work well. It took a lot of pressure to get multiple cloves through, but I could do it (and my upper arm strength is about equal to...well, let's just say it's bad). And the heaviness might be an issue for some, but that's probably something that contributes to the strength. Those are the strengths and weaknesses. Hope it's enough info for you to make a decision.<br /><br />One other thing. It's pretty funny. This press comes packaged so beautifully (heavy box, satin lined, etc.) I had a tough time throwing away the package. Knew I wouldn't need it, and it just takes up room, but I still held on to it for a week before I could toss it.",4.0
1393,"I love this garlic press. Peeling and then mincing with a knife seemed to take forever, but now I just throw a couple into the press, give it a good squeeze, scrape with my knife and I've got some minced garlic. And I didn't have to peel it first. Wish I would have bought it months ago. I haven't used the peeler yet.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, it works great with ginger too!",5.0
1394,"I love this amazing garlic press! It is the best press I have ever owned. It seriously squeezes even large cloves through like butter.  It is solid in construction and super good quality. It is easy to clean and use. Both myself and husband are so impressed we are never buying pre minced garlic again.  It also comes with a garlic peeler. Where has that thing been all my life? It worked so nicely it was a great surprise to me. I had never used one like it before but it took the skins off cloves in seconds and then they were all ready to use in my  new press. Let me tell you, fresh pressed garlic is sooo much better then jarred and so much finer then chopped. I love the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press so much I am giving it 5 stars and if I could give it more I would",5.0
1395,The packaging is so sleek and beautiful on this product.  It makes you feel like you are receiving a high end item.  I would even give this as a gift to someone who likes cooking!  At first I thought it was too good-looking to use.  It weighs nicely in my hand and presses the garlic with ease.  I have had &#34;grocery store&#34; grade presses and this is so much better than anything I have had before.  The peeler is a standard peeler.  Easy to use.  I love it because I reduce the amount of garlicky smell on my fingertips with this tool and it makes my work in the kitchen a little bit faster.  We use garlic in our daily cooking so this has become a go-to tool in my kitchen.,5.0

I will admit up until buying this fabulous  garlic press, I would buy the garlic in the jars. I used to hate peeling  garlic and cutting it up in tiny bits. Not only was it time consuming it also made my fingernails and hands stink. Yuck!  After buying this press I don't think I'll ever stray away from fresh pressed  garlic. The silicon sleeve makes peeling garlic super fast and easy. (See video.)  The press itself was super easy to use and didn't feel cheap or flimsy as I was pressing down.<br />The only cons that found were it did not come with instructions and a few cosmetic blemishes on the press. I also wish it came with a small brush to help clean all the holes.  Otherwise it is a great product and would make a great gift for anyone who cooks with garlic.",4.0
1397,"Sometimes you can tell the quality of what you purchased by the way it's packaged and this garlic press and peeler was absolutely no disappointment.  The quality of the press is amazing, stainless steel, heavy enough to know that it's not going to fall apart and will last for years. The peeler, exactly what she would've expected. Both do the job fantastically, couldn't be happier with my purchase and I can only imagine that all of the other products by this company will be equally as great  in quality and results.  This is definitely one product you will not be disappointed and once you receive it - a must have for every kitchen.",5.0
1398,"Have used this press twice now and like it very much. What I really like is the construction seems to be very sturdy and high quality. The handles do not flex while pressing the garlic (neighbors have an OXO and other have a KitchenAid and remark their presses handles flex). I have not attempted to press more than two cloves simultaneously yet it did very well with two cloves. The minced garlic came out easily and the peel I inadvertently left of the clove remained in the chamber. Clean-up was very quick and simple. I find it amazing that the seller provides an email detailing use of the garlic press, however like anything else if you haven;t used one them some instruction could be useful. The garlic peeler is a nice addition and I used it to successfully for removing the peel off of most of the cloves. There was one clove where I didn't do justice to the peeler and inadvertently left some peel on the clove. Not the fault of the peeler but rather my mistake in not noticing some peel remained.To be honest I knew this press would work much better than my 12+ year old plastic press. Therefore my level of expectation wasn't too high. Regardless I am quite pleased with this press and would highly recommend it.",5.0
1399,"This is sturdy, well made, I love it, except for one problem: my old garlic press had a little plastic plate with tiny teeth sticking out, which when inserted in the plate with holed, would push the leftover garlic skins out of the press. It's a very common feature, and perfect for making cleanup easy. Every garlic press should have this.... It's a real pain to clean without.",4.0
1400,"I previously used a plastic garlic press and it was a giant pain to use, it never felt like it pushed all the garlic through and was terrible to try and clean.  I decided to try out a metal one and i am very pleased i did!  This one has been wonderful!  It's strong enough to press garlic through with ease and the included peeler is surprisingly nice!  It doesn't remove all of the outside skin as i would have expected but it loosens it up to the point where you can just pick it off.  The packaging it is in is quite fancy looking, we decided to discard the packaging for space saving reasons but it would look very nice stored in it!  Cleaning as well is very easy however DO NOT let it dry before you clean it, it was awful trying to remove the dried up bits afterwards!  A short soak in warm water helped though.  I do not at all regret my purchase!",5.0
1401,"Great product, the quality is excellent and support from Alpha Grillers has been outstanding.<br /><br />Because of the mess and tedium associated with using garlic, I have never really learned how to properly incorporate fresh garlic in my cooking (admittedly I'm not much of a home chef).<br /><br />This garlic press is much more efficient in creating small bits of garlic than I have ever been able to cut by hand and small bits impart more uniform flavor than larger &#34;chunks&#34;, so less is more (one can use a bit less pressed garlic for a recipe).<br /><br />We are not big garlic lovers (never have liked the little garlic &#34;fire bombs&#34; that one seems to get with irregular, hand minced  garlic) but certainly do enjoy some garlic in our recipes.  This garlic press definitely delivers.<br /><br />Because of the stainless steel construction and the swing out garlic clove basket, it’s easy to clean as well.",5.0
1402,"This garlic press has an marvelous design.  Really well supported press that crushes garlic with ease.  The handles are one solid piece which makes it much more durable.  The garlic peeler is a nice touch as well. First time using one and for such a simple idea it works great.  My only gripe about this product is cleanup.  Unlike other presses there is no easy way to push out the garlic pieces that get stuck in the basket.  I have seen similar product with a spiked clear used when u flip the press in the opposite way.  I supplied my feed back to alpha grillers and their advise was to rinse with hot water and then use a knife to push out garlic still stuck in effected holes.  I am sorry but do i really want to be spending my time pushing out garlic pieces? The basket is not one solid piece so garlic will sometimes get stuck in the seams.  Again beautiful product and very strong, it gets the job done. However cleaning is just a bit more tedious then the competition.",4.0
1403,"You'll have to lose this kitchen tool because in my opinion it's indestructible; you're not going to wear it out, it's not going to pop a rivet, rust, or discolor.  It has a larger screen/cage to press in/against than the one it replaced, and the angles on the grip give me more leverage to crush with than what it replaced. Because the cage area is larger I find it easier to remove the residual clove from. The press it replaced had smaller holes than necessary and I had to find a wire or a toothpick to clean it out after every use, this one can be squirted clean, at most a finger nail in support of cleaning is the most it will ever need. Yea, my old one lasted too, to it's credit, but I'm glad it's gone because this replacement is simply better in every way you'd measure.  I received this press a couple of months back and before writing the review I have taken the time to use it, run it through the dishwasher, toss it in a drawer with other utensils; all the things you'd expect. It's very sturdy, you're not going to break, bend, it or scratch it. I replaced an aluminum press that's been around forever, but aluminum is soft and it takes on a color that doesn't look clean even though it is. My old one would barely hold one clove and while this new one will hold more than one clove you can't do a whole bulb in one pressing, and who is strong enough for that anyway? This StarPack Home Premier Series press comes out of the dishwasher shinning back at me as if brand new. Since a garlic clove is never going to wear it down this press will look new every time I reach for it, and I don't have that many things I can say that about. This introduced me to a line of products that I'll buy into as my need arises, if everything is made this well then it's all a top value",5.0
1404,"This comes packaged so great and works so well you will want to buy another as a gift. Very durable. Has a great weight to it but is not cumbersome. So far we have used it for fresh garlic and ginger. It presses so easily! We had gone through so many presses before that I was fed up with buying them. We had resorted to store bought minced garlic until we decided to give this a try. Note the warranty!  The silicone peeler is great too. Lets face it, getting the smell of garlic off your hands isnt always the easiest thing to do. Love the fact that we can now have fresh garlic and ginger at home without the hassle of fighting our old presses. Clean up is also quick and easy.",5.0
1405,"This set tackles tasks quite outside my previous experience. I just started cooking, at age 65.  I love garlic but shied away because it is such a hassle to peel and slice.  This solved both those problems.<br /><br />The press takes a little strength to squeeze so the fat handles are essential.<br /><br />More even than most cookware, it's important to clean it before left-over elements dry onto it, due to small holes and corners.<br /><br />The peeler doesn't solve things as well as I'd like, though it's much better than trying to peel without it.  Plus, it is usually superfluous if you're using the press.<br /><br />Now I use much more garlic!",5.0
1406,"All stainleass steel- at least the press end is. The construction looks and feels solid. I just go another last week that I sent back and subsequently ordered this one, because the other one had some kind of &#34;sprayed&#34; coating on it (which my previous one also did and eventually that peels/corrodes off and must get into your food). This one has non of that. Just got and used once -it works great !",5.0
1407,"I wasn't even sure what the roller was, when I purchased this, but I've gotten far more use of the roller than the press.<br /><br />Here's a tip for preserving garlic: extract it from the clove, roll it out to remove the skin, toss in blender, top with olive oil, blend just a few second until desired mince texture is achieved, then store the mixture in an airtight container in the freezer. It will easily last 6 months to a year with minimal oxidation and fresh taste of the oil and garlic.",5.0
1408,"Bought this on a lightning deal. I had a garlic press, this one looked much nicer than mine and I have never had a garlic peeler and since the price was so low I thought why not buy this set. The garlic press is MUCH nicer than the one I have. As for the garlic peeler - AMAZING! Can not believe I have never had one before this. Actually I was very skeptical on how it would work. I only had 1 garlic clove to peel, but it took about 2 seconds to peel it! The peel came of super easy and all of it came off! All I can say is AMAZING!!",5.0

I could never get it to work right. So far this one does just what it should. Its build really well. No cramping your hand trying to get it to press. Its also easy to clean and larger than the last one I owned. The little roller thing is great for cleaning up your garlic before pressing. Simply pop it in and roll it back and forth apply pressure. Easy peasy!",5.0
1410,"Alex and I are reviewing this product we received a few days ago, and we absolutely love it! Let us start of by saying the packaging was designed perfectly. The sleek designed looks very modern, the font is a perfect size and very easy to read. What I like most about the package is the soft silk liner. The box is so nice, I don't want to store it anywhere else besides the regular box it came in. I would be too afraid of it getting ruined if stuffed in a draw. Another great thing about the presser is its not like other garlic pressers. It's design is very durable, and is definitely not cheaply made. The quality of it is rich, looks and feels long lasting. I feel I will get lots of use out of this product!<br /><br />  The peeler is a great tool, and I love the design. It was so easy to peel the garlic, I was so amazed on how much time I saved while using it. Unlike other peelers, this one was very easy to use. When I began using the presser, I noticed it was very easy to put pieces of garlic in the chamber for the garlic to be pressed. I placed the garlic in the chamber and closed the handles down. When I did, I noticed how precise each press became. The garlic came out amazing and I like the size of how small each piece became. I repeated each step, and each piece of garlic came out perfect each time.  I have never had any other presser and peeler set like this before. I absolutely love this product.<br /><br />  When it comes down to cooking, I like my ingredients to be precise, the perfect size, and quality is very important. When I cook, I also want the right tools to make each piece unique, and easy. The Garlic Press and Peeler Set does it all! I highly recommend anyone to get this product. If you don't have one, I recommend you get your hands on this as soon as you can!",5.0
1411,"If there is one thing I love, it's fresh garlic. If there is one thing I absolutely hate, it's fresh garlic. I have to laugh at that since it's a real love hate relationship but there is nothing better than fresh garlic with your food. But there is nothing better than not having to peel or slice your garlic. This is the most genius invention ever. You put the whole garlic in (peel and all) and with a little force, the entire thing comes out. Now if you don't want to push hard, then you'll want to use the peeler that it comes with and then put the garlic clove in. Either way they are both great and a must have for the kitchen. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who has a love for food!",99
1412,"I have never owned a garlic press in my life.  This is my first experience with one.  My hubby has been wanting me to incorporate fresh garlic into our diet for years.  Well, I personally don't care for it, so never obliged.  Now that we are focusing more on our health, not that we are unhealthy, but want to have better health, and lose about 15 pounds each, I gave in to the garlic once I had this opportunity to review this product.  Of course, it certainly helped to see how my daughter and her husband have each lost about 15 pounds over the last couple of months, and she uses garlic all the time and recommended that I get a good quality garlic press not only for fresh garlic, but ginger as well.  Hello Alpha Grillers!<br /><br />I already had fresh ginger in my pantry, and decided to try that first.  What a disaster.  Not blaming the garlic press at all, but the ginger.  It was very green, not bright yellow like we were used to.  I did get a lot of ginger juice though.<br /><br />That night I purchased a better root branch of ginger.  Much better results.  This was so cool, so easy. Love it!  We eat raw ginger on our tuna/salmon sandwiches daily.  I no longer have to worry if I'm going to end up getting my fingers cut when I sliced ginger, because I can now put it through this great garlic press.  Never would have guessed ginger would be so difficult to slice.<br /><br />Next I actually tried garlic.  Yep!  The garlic peeler worked wonders.  Just place a clove of garlic in the tube, rub it around a bit, and like magic the skin is off and ready for the press.<br /><br />Then I placed the garlic in the press, squeezed, much lighter than I had to with the ginger, and I was amazed at how swift this process was.  Painless, quick, and I didn't even have to touch the left overs in the press.  I just removed that with a butter knife.<br /><br />Now I'm going to make humus using the fresh garlic, butternut squash, and a few other seasonings.<br /><br />This is so easy to use.  Don't have to squeeze very hard.  Works great on ripe (if that's the correct term) of ginger root, and very slick process for the garlic cloves.  Washes up quick and easy by hand.  Peeler is a snap too.  Love this product.",5.0
1413,"Can I say that I never knew such a device existed!  A Garlic Press and Peeler! What will they come out with next? To think that for so many years, I've been hand peeling and chopping up my garlic by hand! Every week, I go to the garden and grab some tomatoes, garlic, and peppers to make my husband salsa. I don't even want to add up how many garlic cloves that makes! lol<br />I'm a busy mom of three so anything that can make my life easier and save me some time is a device I want!<br /><br />The Garlic Press and Peeler Set by Alpha Griller is not only an amazing kitchen utensil but it's sleek and sturdy design make it appealing to the eye. Even the packaging it appealing. I've never recieved a cooking utensil so nicely packaged. It would make a great gift.<br />The peeler is something I never would have guessed. In fact, when I took it out of the box I had to look at it twice. lol  The peeler is such a simple item. Simply put the garlic clove inside the tube and roll it back and forth. No more annoying peels getting stuck to your hands like glue.<br /><br />But what I LOVE is the Garlic Press. In my family we use garlic in everything we eat, It's not only tasty but garlic is good for you. It purifies your blood. So it's as important as salt in my kitchen.  But I hate having to chop, chop, chop to get it as tiny as possible. The Garlic press makes my life easier.<br />It's just as simple to use as the garlic peeler. In fact, you don't even need to peel the garlic before using the Garlic Press. Just place the garlic clove inside the press and squeeze the handles together. Out comes perfectly minced garlic ready for cooking. The stainless steel design makes it easy to clean and care for. And it's dishwasher safe!",5.0
1414,"The Alpha Griller Garlic Press and Peeler work fantastic! We have used many type presses over the years for making homemade sauces, marinades, dips, etc. The Alpha Griller garlic press minces the garlic so much finer than other 'name brand', more expensive presses. The accompanied  garlic peeler removes the outer skin of the garlic perfectly. After mincing the garlic to a super fine texture, cleaning the solid stainless steel utensil is so easy. The leftover garlic fiber is easily and quickly removed with a quick flip with a knife or fork. I have been accustomed to using 'other brands' cleaning tool that line up with the presses holes. I always found this cleaning process to be annoying. I was a bit concerned prior to making this purchase because it doesn't have this attachment. My concerns were totally unfounded after using the Alpha Griller Press and Peeler many times. The Alpha Griller Garlic Press and Peeler performs exceptionally well, whether you are a cook who is just learning or a person who appreciates well prepared food.<br />  It is a pleasant surprise when products exceed one's expectations, a rarity in today's world it seems. I wish the small family business who make the Alpha Griller Garlic Press and Peeler all the success that they have earned.",5.0
1415,"I use a lot of garlic and ginger in my cooking and use a garlic press (Kuhn Rikon) almost everyday.<br /><br />I have to say it's an excellent garlic press. Stainless steel, so it will last a long time and it seems very sturdy and well made. It was easy to use for both peeled and unpeeled garlic and peeled ginger as well. I use both in my homemade salad dressing almost daily and this press made it easy to mince both types of garlic and the ginger. I do prefer to peel the garlic first as you get a bit more out then if you don't peel it, but it works well both ways.<br /><br />What I especially loved was the garlic peeler! I make a ginger garlic paste for Tikka Masala sauce quite often and as I make a batch I usually end up peeling 30-40 cloves of garlic at one go. It takes forever! The garlic peeler seems so simple but it works like a charm. Put the clove of garlic in and roll it for a few seconds and bam - the peel comes right off.  My husband was watching me test it out and he said he wouldn't have believed it, if he hadn't been watching me. LOL<br /><br />It comes in a beautiful fabric lined box and would make a perfect hostess gift. The garlic peeler is amazing and the press works great as well. Highly recommended.",99
1416,"This stainless steel garlic press is sturdy, attractive, and has a larger than normal compartment for the garlic cloves. It really has a top of the line appearance. Most importantly, it does a good job of mincing the garlic cloves.<br /><br />The rubber tube is to peel the cloves. Just put the clove inside and rub the rubber back and forth until the garlic peeling has separated.<br /><br />As others mentioned, the box this press comes in is also very nice. I was surprised at material the press rests in within the box. I'd recommend keeping the box for storing the press in rather than just dumping it into your kitchen utility drawer.<br /><br />I was sent a complimentary product for evaluation and review, and I'm most impressed with what we received.<br /><br />Recommended.",99
1417,"Over the years I've gone through several garlic presses-- you buy it, it says dishwasher safe, but after a few runs through the dishwasher it turns dark gray and loses the smooth external texture for a chalky texture. This press is completely different. This is like the BMW of garlic presses/peelers.<br /><br />It is well designed, extremely durable yet not heavy. It opens for cleaning very easily and survives the dishwasher with ease. The way that the handles open and leave the basket/grate free swinging allows the basket to be cleaned on both sides so you won't have garlic parts left in it if you use the dishwasher.<br /><br />I dishwasher wash everything so it was fantastic to find a garlic press that could fit in to my routine and not force me to sink wash. Completely pleased with this press.<br /><br />Additionally comes the peeler. I had never used one of these, and during first use I had a guest cook making a meal for friends and he found the peeler fantastic as well. It's so simple-- put the garlic in, press/roll, and voila-- it's peeled.<br /><br />The box and packaging itself is absolutely first rate and is gift-worthy. You could easily present this kit as a gift and have it received as a premium device. Fully recommended.<br /><br />If you have any particular questions feel free to ask them below in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them ASAP.<br /><br />By a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon.

Even *IF* the product itself is a dud  (which it's not,  just theoretical) then i wouldn't have really minded because of the great service i recieved.  At AlphaGrillers they are friendly and personable and made sure your needs and expectations are met.<br />Onto the garlic press:<br />I was so excited to use this since all the ones I've found in Israel are duds.<br />This one is flawless. I could tell it was quality the moment i held it in my hands. I've never experienced a mincer that could work through garlic skins but to my amazement it does it. The silicone peeler is good too!<br />Couldn't be happier for the product and even though it's more I've paid for one before,  i would say it is worth it.<br />Thanks AlphaGrillers",5.0
1421,"This is awesome product. My son does not like chopped garlic in food. When I use garlic press, he does not notice there is garlic in the food. The garlic press is high quality and cleaning after using is easy. It also comes with garlic peeler which makes it easy to peel. I love this product, I would highly recommend it to give a try.",5.0
1422,This is a serious garlic press. The weight is perfect as well it’s easy to clean. The peeler works amazing for most all pieces of garlic (some are just simply stubborn). The seller also seemed very interested on my satisfaction with the product which beat all. A great buy.,5.0
1423,"I got a free sample of this product to review honestly.  I'm not affiliated with the company.<br />This set is heavy duty stainless steel.  It fits very nicely in my hand; it's smooth and the hinges and metal is all well fitted so it is very easy to open and close. Operation is quite simple.<br /><br />There's a garlic peeler with this set- that's the little black thing you see.  I put a clove in it, and just rolled it around and the paper skin all came right off, leaving just the clove.  Of course, if you don't want to use that, you can press the entire clove with it on, and only the minced garlic will come out, leaving the paper inside.<br /><br />One thing that makes this press unique is that it has 3 sections.  It makes it very easy to clean.<br /><br />The hinge provides plenty of leverage so that pressing the garlic is very, very easy, with little force needed.  You just put the garlic in the chamber, and close it up and squeeze it a tad- the finely minced ready to use garlic comes right out of the bottom of the press.  I generally squeeze mine right into the pot or salad I am making.  This helps make a great bruschetta!<br /><br />The garlic peeler easily fits on either side of the handle for easy storage and retrieval.  One thing I noticed about this set was the beautiful box and presentation that it made- it comes in a nice box with a black silky lining.  I think it would make a very nice gift for anyone that enjoys cooking.  It's all stainless steel and the joints  at the hinges are all well fitted.  It should last a long time.",99

I love the packaging of this, as well!<br />This is stainless steel so there is no issues with corrosion like you would get on some other products.  This product is easy to use and better yet, even easier to clean!<br /><br />The seller offers a lifetime guarantee, if you don’t love it (who wouldn’t love this product), you can send it back!!<br /><br />I use garlic in just about everything I eat, so I have found myself using this a lot in my kitchen since I received it! I no longer have to spend countless amounts of money on minced garlic in the jars at the grocery store! This product is great and I love it!<br /><br />This would be an amazing gift to get someone for Father’s day or to just purchase for yourself!<br />5/5 and I would recommend this to anyone!!",5.0

My last one snapped in half recently after only 12 months of use<br /><br />I can confirm that your Garlic Press is absolutely and unequivocally the best press I have ever used! It has a sturdy and quality feel to it and it quite simply does what it says on the tin. Fantastic yield from a few cloves, peeled or not! Simple to clean too. What's not to like. Just wish I had found it years ago!",5.0

First off, the box it came in was really lovely- perfect for giving as a wedding present.<br /><br />Secondly, the press is very heavy duty and sturdy. It works well without need for undue pressure.<br /><br />I was unsure about the silicone peeler--- before I bought this I had never heard of such a thing. However, I found it easy to do and much more convenient then unpeeling garlic myself.<br /><br />I have not had any issue with rusting or discoloration. If you rinse out after using, its super easy to clean. Leaving the garlic to dry can make it more difficult with the small holes, however.<br /><br />Altogether it was a great buy and it something I will be keeping in mind for future gifts.",5.0

1428,"The Alpha Grillers Best Garlic Press And Peeler - Solid Stainless Steel Mincer And Silicone Tube Roller - Crush Ginger was provided for review.<br /><br />This arrived just in time, I was really getting tired of my previous garlic press, and the Alpha Grillers surpasses my expectations.<br />Not a big deal for me but the fabric lined box makes a nice presentation as a gift.<br /><br />The press is super easy to use, you can mince garlic in the peel or for a little better result use the included silicone tube peeler for quick, clean peeling with no garlic smell from peeling by hand, or knife cleanup using a smash and peel method. My only negative is the silicone tube had a bit of flashing on the outside from manufacturing, but it was easy enough to remove.<br /><br />The fit and finish on the press is superb, the hinge action is smooth with no wobble and the shiny chrome finish is easy to clean with a quick rinse or in the dishwasher. All the smashed garlic was expelled out the mincing holes, no leaking out the sides and the flip out mincer stays connected so there is nothing to lose while providing easy to access for thorough cleaning.<br /><br />Mincing ginger takes a little more pressure than garlic, but it works just as well. In either case the flush bottom of the press makes it easy to slide your knife along the bottom edge and remove all the minced pieces and juices. You no longer have any excuse to not use fresh garlic or ginger for your saut&eacute;, stir fry, soup, stew, marinade, etc.",99
1429,"This garlic press from Alpha Grillers is made of stainless steel and is very hefty. The hinge is especially well-made, a sure sign of quality. The modern design is striking.<br /><br />It not only instantly and easily minces garlic, but it can do so with the peel still on and without requiring too much pressure. It has three main parts rather than two so as not to make a mess. It is also easier to clean under the faucet than the ones I have used before, and can even go in the dishwasher.<br /><br />The press will also mince ginger although it does a better job when the ginger is not old and fibrous. It could also be used for mincing shallots or even for squeezing key limes.<br /><br />A garlic peeling tube is included as a bonus. It actually does work much better than I expected, but when I am using garlic I always have the cutting board and knife in use anyway, and simply use the flat side of the knife to crush it. However, the tube will peel garlic without crushing it, so it would be handy for peeling garlic when making pickles or chicken with forty garlic cloves or in other recipes where the whole cloves are needed.<br /><br />This garlic set also comes in a nice box and would make a great gift.<br /><br />Alpha Grillers provided a sample for evaluation and review.",5.0
1430,"My husband and I are garlic lovers, but are usually too busy to chop it up by hand and I dread pulling out the food processor because I hate to clean it afterwards! We were lucky enough to receive this item to review and we are so happy with it. It is a sturdy, well-made stainless steel garlic press that takes all the mess and work out of crushing fresh garlic for use in any recipe.<br /><br />We love that you can just put several cloves in, peels and all, squeeze and beautiful, fragrant, fresh garlic comes out. However, one of the coolest things about this garlic press is that it comes with a rubber peeler, too. I have to admit, it kind of blew my mind that all you have to do is roll a piece of garlic, with the skin on, in this rubber tube and the skin just falls completely off. It makes it a little easier to press and clean when the garlic is skin free.<br /><br />Speaking of cleaning, you can just toss both pieces in the dishwasher when you're done and they come out clean. This is super important, because we hate doing dishes! We've used both pieces many times, now, and washed over and over with no problem.<br /><br />Another great thing about this garlic press and peeler is the super-stylish box, and satin bed it comes in. With the great price, and the lovely packaging I would definitely buy this as a gift as well!",5.0

1432,"I've used this product about half a dozen times now and I am impressed with it overall.  It does a very nice job crushing garlic.  You do have to squeeze pretty hard if you put in a large piece of garlic, so I could see why a few reviewers had difficulty with that portion of it (especially if they are arthritic).  I love the ingenuity of the construction - the press' ability to swing 360 degrees makes it easy to clean.  However, I didn't give the garlic press 5 stars for 2 reasons:  1)  Every now and then, a tiny piece of garlic would get stuck in a crevice and I'd have to use a toothpick or small fork to get it out;  2) It doesn't work well on ginger.  When I tried crushing ginger with it, I got a lot of ginger juice (there's an idea, anyone for ginger juice?) and I had to press very, very hard to crush the ginger.<br /><br />I don't know why some reviewers rave about the packaging.  It's nice but I didn't buy this product for presentation, although if you bought it for a gift, the box is a nice bonus.  I purchased this for a utilitarian purpose.  And as far as that goes, I think all in all, this is a very good garlic press - especially for the price.  I highly recommend this product.",4.0

This then allowed me to cut the garlic into thin slices.  Onto the garlic press. I was impressed by the quality and how sturdy it felt in my hands. This is no cheap metal. I placed a clove with the skin on inside the press, applied pressure and presto I had small pieces of garlic. I then removed the skin that was inside the grate. I had so much fun and it was so easy, I was trying to see where I else I needed to use garlic in my meal preparation. Great item and glad I ordered 2, as I will give one to my son.",5.0

Doesn't strain my wrist. And best of all, big and fat pieces of garlic fit in easy peasy. It's seems ridiculous to spend this much on a garlic press but it is worth every penny!

I am a proponent of the health benefits of garlic and use it extensively in my cooking and salads.<br /><br />A few old school chefs, however, prefer dicing or crushing/smashing the garlic clove before adding it to food; I believe that is nonsense and much prefer the mince that results from a press. It can be evenly mixed in salads, sprinkled on food or spread as paste on bread etc<br /><br />Over the years I have acquired several garlic presses of various quality and price. Some performed better than others, most broke down and a couple of expensive high-end ones are still usable.<br />My major objection, to all the presses, is the need to squeeze real hard to extrude the garlic; that is a nuisance to elderly, arthritic or weak hands in general.<br /><br />Along comes this terrific, all steel, sturdy garlic press in an elegant sleek design. It is ergonomical and requires minimal squeeze to convey maximum pressure on the contents of the basket. The resulting mince is a homogenous paste whether using a peeled raw clove or one with skin. Also can be used to mince ginger and soft nuts.<br />The press is very easy to clean and is dishwasher safe.<br /><br />The press is attractively packaged in an elegant cardboard presentation box, which would make a nice gift. A silicon tube for peeling cloves is included as a bonus.<br />And best of all the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press has a lifetime warranty and excellent friendly customer service.<br /><br />A complimentary sample was provided for review.",99

She bought a cheap garlic press at the dollar store. The thing worked, but it was messy and very hard to use. My wife is a small woman and it hard for her to use the cheap press. This garlic press is heavy, but it works really well. You put the garlic cloves in the basket and press it. It was easy for my wife to do with two hands. She said it was very easy to use. I tried it with an peeled garlic clove (she pealed with the peeler) and it worked perfectly. We will use this garlic press every time we need one for all of my wife's recipes. The press is made of strong stainless steel and will last a lifetime. It is easy to clean. We used warm water, soap and a sponge and easily cleaned the press.

With the Henckels I would press for all I was worth...several times. Handles were wobbly. There was a lot of waste which I literally scraped out with a knife and chopped for use. I tried my new press from Alpha Grillers as soon as I received it. I was happy and surprised to see all (lots) of the garlic push through with one press and very little waste. No scraping and chopping! Nice solid feel too. Alpha checked to see if I received their press and if I had any questions. Now that tells me at least 2 things, they're confident that their product is top notch (otherwise why contact to hear whining) and they are personable...I rarely write reviews.",5.0

After roughly nine months of having this press I give it 5 stars and highly recommend it.  My earliest impression I had of the press is how solid it feels . It feels like it was built to last and so far that first impression was on point. So many products you get these days are built to break after you have had them a while, not this. By the way besides being solidly built it does an excellent job of crushing garlic. Like I said I cannot say enough good things about this press.

The head rotates to easily insert and remove garlic cloves and this design also makes it easy to rinse to remove the particles left behind. The hooks on the bottom are ideal if you have a hanging rack too. The garlic peeler tube works surprisingly well - I haven't tried this before but you just put the unpeeled cloves in there, roll a couple of times and out comes completely raw garlic. It's a very neat solution to unwrapping garlic that's elegantly simple and also easy to clean.

Im constantly peeling and crushing garlic and it becomes really obnoxious to do every day.  This press allows me to fly through garlic cloves and also prevents me from<br /><br />HOW TO USE THE PRESS<br />To mince garlic simply place one or two peeled or unpeeled cloves in the chamber, bring the handles together and squeeze.<br />Ensure that face of the press is pointing directly down before you press, unless you want to spray garlic mince across your kitchen!<br />Once you have pressed the garlic, use a knife to slice it free from the front of the press.<br />Put your finger on the lip of the chamber, to prevent it from moving upwards, then open up the handles.<br />If you were using unpeeled cloves the peel will still be inside the chamber.  Pick it out using your knife.<br />Repeat the above steps till you have enough garlic mince.<br />To mince ginger, make sure you cut the skin off first, otherwise it will be very hard to squeeze the ginger through the holes.<br /><br />HOW TO USE THE PEELER<br />Make sure the peeler is dry before use.  If it is wet inside it won't work as well as the clove will slide around inside.<br />Pop one unpeeled garlic clove into the peeler.<br />Roll it back and forth on a flat surface a few times. You should hear a bit of a crackling noise as the skin becomes separated from the garlic.<br />Tip the peeled clove out, then flick the peeler to knock out any loose skin from inside the tube before putting in the next clove<br />Repeat these steps until you have enough peeled garlic.<br /><br />TIP FOR OPTIMAL PEELING:<br /><br />There is a knack to getting the best results.  If you don't push down hard enough while you are rolling the peeler you will find that the skin doesn't all come off, but if you press down too hard you will squash the clove, causing garlic juice to come out.  This will prevent to peeler from working as well since the juice will make the clove slide around inside when you roll.<br /><br />I recommend that you start with gentle pressure and see if you get clean separation of skin from the garlic.  If so, great - you have already got the hang of it!  If not, keep trying with a little more pressure until you do.  After a few cloves you should be a certified garlic peeling veteran :)<br /><br />CLEANING<br /><br />Simply rinse the press in hot water and use a knife to pick out any bits that get stuck in the holes.  Do this immediately after use and you will find that you can remove all the garlic and peel very quickly and easily.  You can leave it at that, or if you want to remove any residual garlic smell from the press either put it in the dishwasher or wash it in soapy water.<br /><br />For the peeler, flick it a few times with your finger to knock out any big bits of peel, then give it a brief rinse to remove any smaller bits still stuck to the inside of the tube.<br /><br />STORAGE<br /><br />Since the press is made made from solid, high quality stainless steel it is very resistant rusting, so you don't have to worry about how you store it.  Just let it dry and pop it in the draw.  The peeler is also very durable and can be stored as you choose.",5.0

I've been looking for a really good garlic press that would not break my wallet for quite some time, but either they were way out of my price range or were as shoddy as the one I used to have before receiving this product. When I picked it up out of that fine gift box I knew I'd found THE ONE. This press set is of the quality I'd expect from high end culinary retailers but can't seem to find in my price range. The peeler works perfectly and leaves me with whole cloves for the dishes that require it, but the press is truly amazing. It minces well and easily; the ergonomic design particularly impresses me. No more aching hands and carpel tunnel from squeezing (and squeezing) and still ending up with poor results. It cleans with ease (opens wide for easy washing) and while it says it can be machine washed so far I'm cleaning it by hand with warm water and a soft kitchen brush to remove the small remaining pieces or skins (yes, you can mince garlic with the skins on and the cleanup is quite easy). I haven't tried mincing ginger yet, but I plan to. Kudos, Alpha Grillers, for a very fine product that's reasonably priced.",5.0

1462,"I have used a few different garlic presses, and some worked great, others not so much-but NONE of them came with a garlic peeler. This was a first for me. I typically press my garlic while its peel is still on, so it takes a pretty good amount of pressure no matter what. I do (or did) that because I hated the wet, sticky feeling left on my hands after trying to peel garlic by hand. Therefore, I didn't peel it.  That's one of my favorite features of this product, the peeler. Just place garlic inside, roll it under your hand, then out comes freshly peeled garlic and not a drop of garlic juice or peel gets stuck to your hands-I love it!<br /><br />The press works great as well. Whether the garlic was peeled or not, I have gotten nothing but perfectly pressed garlic and no crazy mess or hard to clean press. Just pull the peel out of the press and rinse, or just simply rinse the press in hot water and it comes clean rather easily. I use a lot of fresh garlic in my recipes, so this press and peeler get a lot of use. The press is sturdy and high quality and I can see it lasting me a long time.

1464,"Believe it or not, this is my first garlic mincer/peeler ever in my 30 years of cooking. I love to cook, but I've somehow managed to do so without my own mincer for my entire life. Garlic factors a lot into many of my dishes and I've always just minced them by hand. It takes a while, but I never thought to do it with a press. Sure, I've used garlic mincers before on occasion when cooking at friends' houses, but they weren't as effective as this one. Most are simple ""foot and bucket"" 2 piece devices: a piece of metal shaped like a hammerhead squishes down onto the garlic clove placed in the scoop area and presses the flesh through the screen at the bottom. These require the clove to be peeled first, and often the pulp would squish out the side of the mincer.<br /><br />This mincer sports a much different and more effective design. It has 3 moving pieces, with a very large face plate that is fitted to the screen bucket so there's almost no gap. Forget peeling the clove. It goes in unpeeled to save you time. The round handles are comfortable and easy to use.<br /><br />I've used this to easily juice limes and lemons too for ice tea and other drinks! The only drawback is having to cut the wedges down to the size of a clove, but otherwise, this works perfectly! No more hand-squeezing limes. Now I can extract a lot more juice from the fruit. Cleaning is very easily. I recommend a brush.<br /><br />As for the roller, it's simplicity and usefulness is impressive. It's just a silicone tube, but it works wonders. The friction of rolling the tube separates the clove from the husk. A few rolls back and forth with some gentle pressure is all it takes.<br /><br />A+ all the way. It comes with a nice cloth lined giftbox. My only suggestion to the manufacturer would be to make a version with reduced packaging for customers who don't need the presentation.",99

1466,This set is so nice.It came in a box and looks nice enough to add to a gift basket or give as a gift. Really great and I am happy with this. Everyone should have one. Thanks!,5.0
1467,This is a well made quality product! Peel garlic with ease with the silicone peeler! The solid stainless steel garlic press is very well constructed and will not fall apart! Easy to clean and the silicone peeler slides right onto the handle for easy storage! I didn't expect such a quality product when I ordered but I was pleasantly surprised! Packaged in a really nice gift quality box. This may very well be the last garlic press you ever have to buy. It will last me for years! i love it!,5.0
1468,"I was delighted to receive this set by first looking at the box, professional set box and the garlic press looks like with good quality. Tried today to crush some garlic with skin on, came out fine and easy to use. Havent tried the peeler yet but look forward to using it.",5.0
1469,"I love garlic, and I love to use it in artisan bread and rolls.  What I don't love is getting it all over my hands, or watching it slip all over the cutting board while attempting to mince it.  This garlic press has solved my problems, so that jar of dried garlic has hit the can.  Now I can easily use fresh garlic that has so much more flavor than the dried kind.<br /><br />I've had a number of presses over the years, but none have the great characteristics of this press.  It's heavy and heavy-duty stainless steel, heavy enough to press a big clove, heavy-duty enough so it won't fall apart after a use or two. In addition, it's fun to use because it's so easy.  I've filled up a small refrigerator jar, so I'm ready to bake.<br /><br />If you, like me, love garlic but hate the preparation, please get this press.  You'll be delighted!<br /><br />FIVE STARS!",5.0

1471,"Verdict: My husband is the chef of our household, so I had him use this to make homemade garlic bread. As far as the garlic press, he thought it was very nice and felt well-made. It did a good job at mincing/mashing the garlic. Clean-up was easy, and the aesthetic was nice. However, he didn't really understand the point of the peeler and found it unnecessary.<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.",4.0
1472,"Wonderful packaging. Quality tool that will last a long time. This has already saved me a ton of time trying to prepare garlic by hand. The only down side would be cleaning after use, but if tackled right away it's not so bad. So glad I bought this.",5.0
1473,"Received this in the mail today, and I am very impressed! First, the packaging...it comes in a very attractive box, inside the box, the press and peeler are in a clear bag, laying on what looks like jewelers velvet! Very classy. The peeler works fantastically...I had one that I lost, and am so happy to have this one, But the garlic press is the 'jewel' in this box! It is very well made, of heavy duty, shiny, excellent working metal, stainless. It feels good in your hand. I had to try it right away...it's a champ at garlic, with or without the skins! Then I tried ginger....works! I've never had a press that did my ginger...even though they all say they do! This comes highly recommended by me! I'm keeping this, but it would make a very nice gift...by itself, along side some garlic (in netting) and perhaps a box of bread mix...or with all the fixings for spaghetti, or pizza! Don't pass this by...it's a winner!",5.0
1474,"Over the years I've had a few garlic presses I picked up here and there.  The finish came off one in flakes, another broke in half when I tried to squish the garlic clove.  Eventually I gave up and either used the pre-chopped stuff in the jar (until I was served a pizza covered in the stuff - rancid) or smashed and chopped away with a knife as long as my arm to mince my own.  Recently, though, I've acquired a couple of must-have garlic presses - and this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-Garlic-Press-Peeler-Set/dp/B00I937QEI"">Best Garlic Press & Peeler Set</a>&nbsp;is one of them.  It is dishwasher safe and comes with a lifetime guarantee.<br /><br />Using a garlic press is dead-easy.  Put the clove of garlic (or two if they are small) into the chamber of the press, hold it over the pan and squeeze, then use a knife to scrape the resulting paste that didn't fall into the pan off the outside of the press.  You don't even need to peel the garlic!  Takes only seconds - and makes me wonder how many hours of my lifetime I've wasted chopping garlic. (Remove the peels from the press with the tip of the knife.)<br /><br />You can do the same with ginger with a couple of qualifications - peel the ginger first and use ginger that is on the ""newer"" side so that it hasn't become fibrous.  (A great way to keep your ginger ""fresh"" is to put the entire knob through the press, then freeze the results in teaspoon-sized blobs on a cookie sheet.  When it has frozen through you can pack the lumps in a small container for future use.)<br /><br />The peeler is a nice little lagniappe, useful when you want your garlic peeled but the cloves to remain whole.  Nice for making pickles during canning season - and easy enough for the kids to help.<br /><br />Grandma's $0.02 - Sturdy, attractive and easy to clean, I tested this press in my own kitchen and then sent it upstairs for my daughter and SIL to try.  It got rave reviews - and I might have trouble getting it back. A kitchen must have, this comes in a nice presentation box - a great gift for every foodie on your list.<br /><br />NOTE - I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer for testing purposes.",99
1475,If you cook with garlic often then I would recommend saving yourself a lot of time by using a garlic press and peeler. We have had another press for years and we use it a couple of time s week. This is our first experience with a peeler and so glad we have this new cooking tool to use from Alpha Grillers!,5.0
1476,"This is a kitchen must have if you like garlic. It totally changed my life in the kitchen when putting in lots of time peeling garlic. You all know that the garlic smell is hard to get rid of from your hands. The free peeler works well, just remember to put one galic at a time. The press is very well made and probably will last forever. Great investment and once you use it you will fall in love.",5.0

1479,"We eat a LOT of garlic around here so I was happy to accept a free sample of this garlic press & peeler to test and review. I was surprised when it arrived, at the beautiful presentation in a satin lined box, alongside the garlic peeler. The garlic press itself is made of solid stainless steel, a quality kitchen tool. It has a shiny polished surface and a nice balanced weight. I've used garlic press is in the past that were hard to press closed and not easy to handle. This one was quite easy, even with a clove of unpeeled garlic. When I'm in a hurry I just meant them without peeling first. But it's neater and faster if you peel them and the garlic peeler that comes with it makes it simple and quick to peel a clove or two of garlic. You just put them inside the silicone peeling tube and pressing on the tube with your hand, roll the tube back-and-forth on your kitchen counter or other hard surface. The peel comes off and you're left with the peeled clove of garlic.<br /><br />This makes the whole process of peeling and mincing the garlic fast and efficient which is really appreciated when I'm busy preparing a meal. And if a recipe calls for a couple cloves of garlic, half a dozen will be even better, right? Reading about all the healthful benefits of garlic in recent years makes it that much better. (And makes me want to use even more!) Another nice thing about this garlic press is that it's dishwasher safe. Because of the nice presentation in the box it would make a thoughtful and unique gift.",99
1480,"This is a quality product.  I love the peeler, it is so easy.  This could be a lovely wedding or shower gift - it is packaged so nicely.",5.0
1481,"Having tried several recent presses that completely failed at doing the job right, this press is wonderful for the $11.97 paid.  Biggest pet peeve with a press is one that allows some/A LOT of the Garlic to ""leak"" past the ram, making a mess, and wasting 1/2 of the Garlic.  This one does not do this, and in fact so little residue is left using peeled garlic, it looks like a strip of paper is left in the chamber when done.  Unpeeled Garlic is treated with the same smashing force, and obviously there are more left overs in the chamber, but the results are still just great.<br /><br />The presentation of the press is beautiful, the press itself is so well finished, and feels strong. The supplied peeler works extremely well, despite prior to receiving it I figured was a gimmick...  I was wrong!  It works so well, I am shocked. The seller seems to care about providing us with a quality product, and I am happy to oblige them with my impressions of their product.<br /><br />One knit picky thing I don't like is the chamber/basket is not one solid piece, rather created by folded steel, and at one end the corners are not solid and allow material to get caught.  This hampers clean-up, but is not a huge deal...  Maybe they can work on this, and find an economical solution to this issue.  Thanks for reading my review.",5.0
1482,"I received my new garlic press and peeler set in just 5 days. My garlic press is very easy to use and added a whole new garlic flavor to my food. Just chopping up my garlic (which took a while to do) had a very mild hint of garlic. I LOVE GARLIC and now can actually taste the garlic. It was very easy to use and clean. And my peeler was very fast. I put my garlic clove in my peeler, laid it on the counter and rolled it back and forth 3 times. Completely cleaned it fast. Thank You for this great set. I am very happy with it!!!",5.0

The holes on the garlic press is perfect for letting the garlic flow through provided that I do have to put in more garlic to get anything from it. The peeler was great too and peeled my garlic in under a second.",5.0
1487,"I usually buy garlic from Costco. However, peeling a big bag of garlic is a nightmare for sure. I've just got a discount to buy this item and I gave a try. OMG! It is so easy to peel the garlic. The garlic press is not THAT good, but the peeler is very good quality and thick enough, so my head would not get hurt while peeling. Overall, it is a wonderful item.",5.0
1488,I got one of these!  Can't remember where I got it from but it's awesome!!!  No more mincing garlic with a knife.  It's extremely helpful with my Blue Apron meals that get sent to me.  It's a tiny bit annoying to clean but I'll get over it.,5.0
1489,Got this as a Christmas present and I'm thrilled!  So much easier to clean than my old &#34;round&#34; press that I couldn't get a brush or full finger in.<br />The included rubber skinner was a surprise - It's super effective!  Lovely packaging and a tremendous product at a great price!,5.0
1490,"I have to admit I was skeptical when I read that this garlic press could mince ginger as well.  I've tried that with other presses, and failed.  But I tried it, and it works!  This is one sturdy press, and I highly recommend it for garlic and ginger.  The peeler is fine, as well, though not particularly noteworthy compared to other peelers.<br /><br />Some details (full disclosure... I received this free for testing):<br /><br />* Sturdy construction.  The handle, chamber, and press are all stainless steel.  Everything fits together snugly, and there's a nice ""heft"" to the press that makes it feel solid.<br /><br />* The ""chamber"" is easy to clean.  It's kind of hard to explain, but there are really 3 pieces to this press, all joined together at the hinge.  Between the two handles is the chamber...the basket where you put the clove of garlic or chunk of ginger.  It actually rotates out between the two handles to make it easy to access and clean.  Some presses allow this chamber to be removed from the press entirely.  I like that, on this press, the chamber stays attached to the press, but still manages to be easy to access.<br /><br />* Good pressing action.  Because of the solid construction, it is easy to give this press a good squeeze and not worry about squeezing too hard.  As a result, it can handle garlic (peeled or unpeeled) AND ginger (peeled).  Ginger is far more fibrous  than garlic, and can be a problem for weaker presses.  Like all presses, this one leaves a little garlic or ginger in the chamber that might go to waste.  My suggestion?  After pressing, open it up and use your finger to gently scrape together what's left.  Then, give it one more squeeze.  In this way, you'll get a little more pressed garlic or ginger AND have a little less to clean up when you are done.<br /><br />* It includes a garlic peeler.  I already have a similar garlic peeler.  This one is no better or worse, I guess.  I like garlic peelers, and I like the look and feel of this one, but I don't notice it being any better or worse than the one I've been using.<br /><br />* It looks great!  I own several garlic presses (I think I now have six).  This is the nicest looking one of all.<br /><br />There are so many other garlic presses out there that one could easily overlook this one.  This one is really worth considering!  It's one of the best presses I've used.",99

1496,"I was given a sample of this item free to use and review.<br /><br />This is a nicely made, heavy duty garlic press -- much more hefty and substantial feeling than the one I have been using for the last 15 years.  I think it works well on garlic but have not used it on ginger.<br /><br />I have two small issues with the press--<br />1. the handles are smooth and very slippery when your hands are wet from cooking. I was making cabbage rolls (a messy job) and decided to  put in some more cloves of garlic and couldn't hold onto the press even with both hands. My old press has rough handles, which need cleaning occasionally but make it easier to squeeze.<br /><br />2. I also think the press element (the part with holes) is easier to clean if it comes out of the unit -- it doesn't with this press, but that just means you have to shove something into the small square and scrape out any remaining garlic. Not a big deal. My other press comes apart, and you can put just the grid element into the dishwasher or to soak.<br /><br />The best thing about this kit is the garlic peeler -- who would have thought that such a simple thing could work so well? It is just amazing -- you put the clove into the tube, rub it a few times, and it comes out clean. The tube holds onto the skin. You can clean out the tube by rinsing it when you're all done with your garlic.<br /><br />I use A LOT of garlic, so a heavy duty tool like this is a must have in the kitchen.",99
1497,Really nice. The garlic press is nice and sturdy. Doesn't have a cheap feel to it. I like the garlic peeler but I haven't used it  yet. Overall I'm pretty happy with this purchase.,5.0

Right from the box, this is no ordinary kitchen tool set.  The box is made for gifting with a cloth lined interior.<br /><br />The press itself is made entirely (aside 2 small accents on both handles) of stainless steel for durability and longevity.  This package works really well together.  Place your garlic cloves in the rubber roller and gently roll to remove the outer skin.  After this, pop the cloves one at a time into the press and presto, you now have pressed garlic for all the recipes or uses you need it for.<br /><br />I have tested and used this set for the past week in a variety of applications and meals and really like it.  The set feels really strong, and a complete upgrade to the plastic ones I have used in the past.  Overall, I'm really pleased with this set and recommend it to anyone that works with garlic on a regular and even an irregular basis.<br /><br />[Sample Provided For Review]",99
1499,I absolutely love the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press! I could not believe how heavy duty it is! It works great! I love having the sleeve to peel the garlic so I don't get it on my hands. It is very easy to use and clean! I would definitely recommend this to others!,5.0

1513,Super product. This is my first one of these ever but after a friend said about one she had I had to get one. Love it. Quality product.,5.0
1514,"First, to be clear, I hate garlic.  Well, I don't hate the TASTE of garlic, but I definitely hate the chore of peeling it, chopping it, and getting it all over my cutting board (so that the strawberries I slice the next morning come out tasting like garlic, which is not a good thing in my bowl of Cheerios!).  I also hate getting it all over my hands and under my fingernails; somehow, I can never get rid of the smell, no matter how hard I try.<br /><br />So, I agreed to give the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press a try.  And wow, am I impressed!  I have an old garlic press, one I bought decades ago and have seldom used.  That one was clunky and hard to use, and the garlic just ended up smashed (which might work for some dishes, but not those calling for minced garlic, which is what I most commonly use).  The Alpha Griller's press is sturdy, heavy-weight stainless steel; if has a nice heft to it.  It feels expensive.<br /><br />But beyond that, it does something amazing.  It minces garlic even without peeling it first!  All you have to do is drop a garlic clove into the bowl of the press and squeeze.  The garlic comes out beautifully minced through tiny holes in the press, and the peel remains inside where it's easily tossed into the trash.  With this thing, I can mince unlimited amounts of garlic without ever getting it on my hands, my knives, and my cutting board.  That's sheer genius!<br /><br />The set also comes with a little silicone sleeve which can be used to peel garlic cloves should you want to use them whole (or sliced, I guess).  All you do is put the garlic clove inside the sleeve and roll it around for a bit on your countertop - the clove comes out perfectly peeled.  If you peel your cloves first, they are even easier to mince with this press - you don't have to squeeze as hard!<br /><br />Overall, the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press Set is a great product that does a great job peeling and mincing garlic.  It's dishwasher safe and comes in a lovely satin-lined box - it would make a super gift.  I highly recommend this garlic press set for anyone who hates peeling and chopping garlic as much as I do!<br /><br />[Please note:  I was provided a sample of this product for review; the opinions expressed here are my own.]",99
