0,"Works well but mine corroded after a couple uses, pretty disappointed about that. (Yes, that picture is of my &#34;clean&#34; but corroded garlic press.)",3.0
1,Seems to waste a lot of garlic. Doesn't make things much easier. Still have to peel the garlic and crushing in the thing takes as long as it does to chop and not great results. Try a different one.,2.0
2,Poor chrome plating. Aluminum dust started to show up in the screen side. I dont want this foamy white metal in my food. Tossed it and got a stainless steel one.,1.0
3,"Like the rubber fingers that push out the garlic skins. It does allow garlic to push back along the sides of the press head. Not enough to be a deal killer, just kind of annoying.",3.0
4,"Large! If you want to crush one clove, this ain't it. It's a big device. Still it's nicely made. And since I like garlic, I rarely press just one clove. So it works for me.",3.0
5,you have to use a lot of strength to get everything out of the press,3.0
6,It is a little bulky for my wife's small hands but fits me just fine. It does a nice job mincing the garlic bulbs and the protruding prongs assists in getting most of the bulbs pulp.,3.0
7,Quality is less than expected,3.0
8,"It let a part of the garlic left, and that you then have to cut yourself",2.0
9,"Nice and heavy, but not as comfortable to use as most Oxo products.",3.0
10,"Product is made of cast Zinc, and the hinge between the two lever arms is a bit small, Because of this if you apply any significant force &#34;to crush&#34; the last bit of garlic out it will likely shatter the hinge. This occurred with me on my first use. I purchased at Walmart, and intend on returning it. In the future I will look for a stainless steel option as the hinges appear to be sturdier construction than the cast Zinc.",1.0
11,"Functions great as a garlic press but, if you're going to be washing it in a dishwasher, water gets trapped inside the handle and can dribble out for weeks.",2.0
12,"This was the only garlic press I ever owned and it was horrible. Though I didn't know that until my mother tried to use it one day. Very hard to use, it literally hurt my wrist trying to squeeze it. Also, it just doesn't do the job very well, minimal amount of garlic squeezes out.  She bought me a new press, different brand and it's sooo much easier to use and the amount of garlic is almost 3 times as much that this one produced.",1.0
13,These are a little difficult to use if you're like me and you don't have the strength of a 6' 3&#34; man! I have to use two hands!,3.0
14,most of the garlic is left inside the press and form a film that take you awhile to clean.,2.0
15,"Bought it else where, but the hinge broke today after lightly use for a year.",1.0
16,The finish on the inside started corroding after only a few washes in the dishwasher. Makes it hard to tell if it's really clean. Otherwise a sturdy unit.,3.0
17,Great to use but residue builds up and rusts easily. Disappointed with how it's held up after just a couple months' use.,2.0
18,"I thought that this would be excellent quality given that it is from OXO, however one can tell that corners were cut in the manufacturing. The tolerances are sloppy and the product feels cheaply made. It also takes a surprising amount of force to crush the garlic given how heavy the press is.",2.0
19,I only used this garlic press about 10 times before it broke at the hinge. I would have expected it to last a lot longer.,2.0
20,The holes are large and therefore you won't get finely smashed garlic but more like small chopped pieces. If you want creamy like results then stay away from this product.<br />The other annoying thing is the hole plate too thick so you will lose yield.<br />We used it once and returning it.,1.0
21,"At first I really liked this press. It looks nice, the grip is comfortable, the red rubber does a good job of dislodging the garlic after use. But after about a year the hinge broke apart when I was using it. A year of pressing garlic only means a few dozen uses. That is completely unacceptable. I would save yourself some time and money and buy something built to last.",1.0
22,"Not enough weight to do the job efficiently or completely. Leaves a large amount of the clove unpressed and still in device. I kept it in my drawer for a while because I paid so much for it (compared to the cheapest kind) but finally threw it in the garbage because every time I used it or looked at it, it made me angry to have spent good money on a mincer that wastes so much garlic (the part left behind in the press that is unpressed/unpressable) and the need to use so much hand strength to force the garlic cloves through the press. I will be ordering a better reviewed, more heavy-duty, garlic press to replace this poorly-designed one.",1.0
23,Nice heavy design but hard to operate one handed because in order to load it you have to open it all the way.<br /><br />A fairly large amount of garlic doesnt get pressed through as it should and gets pushed around the edge as the parts fit loosely together. I replaced it shortly after I got it with vacuvin one as this was originally purchased to replace an old garlic press but the older one with a design similar to the vacuvin version bested the OXO one.,3.0
24,"People love OXO Good Grips products in the stores because they feel soft and cushy in one's hand, but that &#34;Good Grip&#34; feeling is essentially a gimmick.  The major flaw (and it is a very significant problem) with many of those OXO products is that they have leaking rubber handles.  That is the case with this garlic press and it is such a big defect that it ruined the product.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- It does an average/decent job of mincing garlic.<br /><br />- The cleaning knobs on the back of the handle do a pretty effective job of cleaning the garlic out of the holes in the face of the press.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />This OXO garlic press, as was the case with at least three other OXO kitchen tools with rubber handles or grips I've owned, has rubber handles that do not seal completely. Soak this item in dishwater or run it through the dishwasher, and if you forget to drain the grips, you're in trouble the next time you use them, as the hollow grips fill up with water. You'll take the press out of your kitchen drawer, put some garlic in it, start to squeeze it over your pot or pan of food, and suddenly as the grips are tipping downward, they'll leak a couple of tablespoons of soapy water into your dish.<br /><br />I tried to seal the grips up with epoxy but it would not stick. After ruining a pasta dish with leaked dish soap, I didn't just retire my OXO garlic press to the back of the drawer, I threw it in the garbage.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />This product is advertised as being dishwasher safe.  I don't believe that claim is entirely true and every time I ran this through the dishwasher, the grip filled up with dishwater; the same happened when I soaked it before handwashing.  A kitchen product that ruins the dishes I am cooking deserves a 1/5-star rating.",1.0
25,"I hate chopping up garlic just as much as everyone else, so I finally broke down and purchased what looked to be the best garlic press out there. I've used it once since then, and hated it. I still had to go through the work of peeling and trimming the garlic, and when I did press it, half of the garlic got stuck in the well of the press. So then I had to try to scrape it out with another utensil. Not worth the hassle!",2.0
26,It broke at the hinges after a couple of years of using it almost every day.  I never really liked this garlic press anyways because it didn't successfully press all of the garlic. Part of the garlic would be stuck inside making it hard to clean.,1.0
27,"Have bought two of these presses in the past 6 years, and both of them have snapped in the same spot after about three years of use ... I use my presses FREQUENTLY, but I don't try to press more than one large clove at once (both times the break happened when I was exerting extra force for a large clove), and I always peel my cloves first.  I like OXO generally; this has a good grip and the chamber size is not as small as some other presses I've tried.  For the price and the amount of use I got out of my press, it was worth it to take a chance and buy another one after the first broke, but I think this time around I'll try something different.  I like the product overall, and I'm not expecting to hand my garlic press down as a family heirloom to future great-grandchildren, but I'm willing to spend to get something that will last longer.",3.0
28,it's too heavy!,3.0
29,"This one is so hard to use, especially for people who dont have strong hands. Only recommend for people who have strong hands.",1.0
30,Handle broke,1.0
