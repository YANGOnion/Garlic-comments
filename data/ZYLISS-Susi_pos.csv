0,"I bought this to replace the 20-year-old Zyliss press I had -- it worked. Just, the person who gave it to me is a toxic mess; I didn't want a reminder of her.<br /><br />I don't know why I waited so long to replace it! This model is so much better!<br /><br />I love this press! I use it for ginger as well. Works perfectly, and I appreciate that Zyliss includes the hole cleaner!",5.0
1,"This is a very effective garlic press with a large capacity. It is in some ways similar to its predecessor, with the very useful plastic cleaning comb. One thing that is different is that the Susi 3 does not broadcast the garlic pieces that come out of the press like its predecessor did - I kind of liked the broadcast feature which was very useful for pizzas.",4.0
2,"Zyliss makes the best garlic press. It works well especially if you are feeling a little lazy and don't want to mince a bunch of garlic with a knife, and I really like how it comes with a tool to clean the holes. The only issue I have is that the design is not as ergonomic as the one I bought 25 years ago but finally broke. The new design is just not as comfortable for people with small hands.",4.0
3,"This is the updated version of the garlic press my dad bought 30+ years ago.  I absolutely love his press and I have not found one like it.  My dad bought me this as a gift and I was skeptical, it looks just like the others that I've tried.  But I was wrong, this is just as great as the original and I couldn't be more happy with it.  No more internal cringing when I need to use fresh garlic!",5.0
4,"Loved this. I have always resisted this purchase, because I have good knife skills. This provides a much more pungent garlic flavor, annd when in a rush, I can use it instead of chopping. It is also very easy to clean with the attached cleaning tool.<br /><br />Highly recommended. rrh",5.0
5,"I was looking for a new garlic press after our old, very old, Zyliss press had been thoroughly worn out. We bought a few other presses from local stores - none of which worked. Finally, found this one - it is FANTASTIC! The press fits tightly, leaving barely anything in the bowl. Very easy, efficient. The scraper/cleaning tool is a great idea, too. I think this is very well constructed, have been using it now for a month. I believe it will serve us as well as our previous Zyliss press. For garlic lovers!",5.0
6,"I love fresh garlic but I don't love the preparation that goes into using it, especially when recipes call for chopped or minced garlic. I also have arthritis in my hands and I need something that will work without excessive pressure.<br /><br />This garlic press will really take unpeeled cloves and produce pure, fresh garlic ready to go. Another reviewer said you needed to clean it frequently if you didn't peel the garlic, but I've done five or six large unpeeled cloves without having to clean till the end.<br /><br />It also produces minced/mashed ginger, although it will press out a lot of juice separately. I add both the juice and the ginger pulp to my recipes. I do a lot of Asian cooking with recipes that call for both fresh ginger and garlic, so this is a real godsend.<br /><br />Cleaning is very easy - scrape out the skins and then the plastic tool, along with running water, will take care of clearing the holes.<br /><br />Last, it does take some effort to close the press, but it's engineered very well so I can wrap both my hands around it instead of just using my fingers.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this.",5.0
7,"I really love this press. We love garlic and eat it almost every day; however, I don't like mincing the garlic. This press works great! You can mince garlic without even peeling first. I had tried a garlic press years ago and hated it. It never pressed out all the garlic, so you either wasted a lot or you had to finish mincing by hand. This one squeezes ALL the garlic out. It takes a little bit of strength in your hands to squeeze, so if you have arthritis or some other strength issue in your hands, you might find it difficult. It's easy to clean an comes with a little rubber brush with teeth that exactly fit into the holes on the bottom of the press. I used this brush immediately after mincing to push out the bits of garlic in the holes while rinsing under running water. Doing this right away, before the garlic has a chance to dry, makes cleaning very easy. I use this press almost every day and would recommend it...in fact, I HAVE recommended it to all my friends and family.",5.0
8,"High quality garlic press.  It does fit in more than one clove.  Although they sometimes slip out as you try to position the press in the hole.  Very easy to crush, with little return pressure to the hand.  So mashing a lot of garlic is going to leave your hands sore.  My only issue was the cleaning wand, brush, or what ever you call it.  The part in the handle that can be removed and pushed through the hole to help clean garlic scraps out of the press.  The little plastic spike must be completely straight for all on them to make it in their selected hole.  One by one the can become bent, and once that happens its like spinning plates getting them to all line up at once.  Luckily the end of the wand has three spikes at the end and it is less likely you will have problems with those not lining up.  It just means you can only do at most 3 holes at a time, but I found that saved more time than baby stepping the all at once side of the cleaning wand.  I have owned garlic presses that were easier to clean but the trade off they had parts that could get lost and make it useless.  The press itself is one unit no part able to come off. I wish the metal rod in the hinge seemed to be stronger, but as of right now the Garlic Press is damage free apart from the cleaning tool.  I don't regret this purchase but there are defiantly things I would like to change about it.  This is a good mid range quality product.  If your looking for a above decent quality item, but don't want to drop the big bucks for one of the top of the line presses than this is a good place to start.",4.0
9,"Been using for 6 years or so. Mine did not include a cleaning tool.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. good tolerances around the plunger- no garlic going around the sides<br />2. easier to squeeze - good handle design<br />3. fits flatter, and smaller in the tiny drawer in my kitchen.<br />4. lightweight<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. aluminum scratches easily (Its not the finish of my car- I don't care so much)<br />2. It does not hold a ton of garlic - a few small bits or a large clove. - but that makes it easier to squish.<br /><br />Hints:<br />1. If you DO NOT try to clean all the garlic bits off between presses then it almost all balls up in the bottom and can be easily removed with your finger.<br />2. If you clean it right away - like within 120 seconds of last press- under hot water all the little micro bits of garlic come out.  I run mine under hot tap water forcing the garlic bits backwards into the press- Garlic by nature has the consistency of superglue if left to sit, on anything. No issues, No toothpick, No toothbrush, No tiny blue things to loose, No craziness, no clogging.<br />3. Remove garlic / onion smell on your hands by rubbing warm soapy hands against something stainless steel - a serving spoon, the side of the sink, whatever. It actually works.<br />4. Cut the hard base off the garlic clove- the skin you can leave on.<br /><br />Note: I wash mine in the dishwasher open on the top rack and have never had an issue with the paint / finish coming off- I'm a pretty heavy user of it (2x daily for 6 years)<br /><br />This has been my only press I have used for the past 6 years- in the year prior to it's adoption I went through 4 others. I'm intrigued by the new model.<br /><br />UPDATE--- I just ordered 2 more- they both had blue cleaning things, they hide in the handle and don't come out easily. - FYI in Sept of 2013 I got ones with cleaning things.",5.0
10,"Once upon a time I used a garlic press that seemed to work and it never occurred to me that there was much difference between them, or even that there were different presses out there.  Then I acquired a different Zyliss garlic press for about six years, and I really liked it, until one day it snapped as I tried to press some garlic with the skin still on.  (Some manufacturers (including Zyliss) say you can do this with their garlic presses, but now, I think I'll just pass on that. But that was a great garlic press.)<br /><br />I then purchased a Pyrex garlic press (no, it wasn't made from glass), thinking it looked well made, and how bad could it be?  But I was very surprised to discover it simply did not work--the handles would meet before much of the garlic had been pressed through the holes.  I really couldn't understand why anyone would make such a thing, but there it is.<br /><br />So I then decided I'd stop fooling around and get myself another decent garlic press, and went through some obsessive review-reading, and finally settled on this one.  It works, and it works well.  Put in the garlic, press, and virtually all of the garlic comes right out through the holes.<br /><br />A few issues for those who are looking for the perfect garlic press:<br /><br />This is made of aluminum.  If you're concerned about Alzheimer's, look for a steel press.  Also, being aluminum, it may not be quite as durable as steel, although it seems plenty tough.  (Yes, I've read about the coating coming off.  We'll see. If that happens I may try to scrape off the rest of the coating.)<br /><br />It doesn't take much effort.  But if you really have difficulty squeezing--arthritis, perhaps--there may be one out there that takes a wee bit less effort.<br /><br />I really don't get the ""hard to clean"" business. Really, I don't.  I've been using garlic presses for many years, almost daily.  When you're done, you rinse it under the tap and stick your finger in there, scrape a little, and it's clean. If it isn't, do it a little more. This one is no different from any other I've ever used. If you need a garlic press with its own cleaner, look elsewhere--and then be sure to keep an eye on it and carefully store it with the press, day after day, year after year, so you don't have to clean with your finger. (My previous Zyliss came with a plastic cleaning tool.  I misplaced it within a week or two and never missed it.) I would never choose a garlic press by whether it comes with its own cleaner, but it takes all kinds.<br /><br />This model holds one large or two medium cloves, not three or four, so if you want to press several big cloves at once, I believe Zyliss makes a larger one you might prefer.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />One year later, the coating has come off the perforated inner surface of the press.  Otherwise, no problems.  Works great!  Even though I once broke a garlic press by squeezing cloves with the skin on, I've been doing that with this one.  Works just fine.",5.0
11,"I used to always mince my garlic by hand, because I love fresh garlic in dishes and didn't really know that garlic presses existed. One day I was watching a cooking show and saw the host press several cloves of garlic into a pan in about 10 seconds. I was in awe, and knew I had to get a garlic press in my hands ASAP.<br /><br />I went to the store and saw a $15 one, and a $3 one. They looked pretty similar, so I just got the cheaper one. I got home and tried it, and it was nearly useless...it just kind of mashed/juiced the garlic, and only a minority of the clove made it through the holes...the rest oozed back up along the sides of the press. Yuck! I was very disappointed.<br /><br />So, I did some research and discovered that you really get what you pay for when it comes to garlic presses. I settled on this guy, and am very happy I did. It's very easy to press a couple of cloves--minimal hand straining, and 100% of the clove makes it through the press. Then, you just scoop out the peel and rinse it. Very, very easy, and very comfortable in my hand. The best part is that my hands don't smell like garlic afterward!",5.0
12,"I like this press. It works well. It definitely requires some hand strength, which I think could be an issue for some people. The crushed texture of the garlic is perfect for my uses. I was super excited that I wouldn't have to deal with peeling the garlic and getting my fingers all garlicky. Yes, but then you spend at least as long and get at least as covered with garlickyness while you pick the squished peel out of the garlic press. You need to clean this immediately after use. Don't let the garlic and juice stick to it, or you will increase the cleaning time quite a bit. Pick the peels out right away and rinse it under hot water in the sink. It does not hold odors, which is great. The plastic peel pick/hole cleaning thing that comes with it is helpful, but if not handled carefully the tines will break off. I'm torn. I like the results and the quickness with which I can get some crushed garlic with this press, but I dread the cleaning process.",4.0
13,"Crushes garlic well & with little effort.  However, one is supposed to be able to put unpeeled garlic in it - when I have done that it is almost impossible to squeeze.",4.0
14,"It really crushes  The whole clove properly unlike other cheaper knock offs  and I love the little cleaning brush ,  can also use it to swipe off the garlic that already came out of the press .  I also use it for chili pepper in small quantities",5.0
15,"This was my first garlic press that I've bought. I absolutely love the scraper that came with it. It's so you can get what doesnt get pressed out instead of using a knife as I've seen others use. Its very easy to use too, not too large or small for my hands.",5.0
16,"I just received. Very pleasantly surprised!<br />We've had a Susi garlic press for at least 10 years. We use it almost daily. It has held up fine.<br />Now my daughters work on an organic farm that grows garlic. The cloves are huge- almost comparable to elephant garlic. I have felt we were abusing it by how full we stuffed it- my husband had to squeeze it- but these are well made and it has not failed.<br />I decided to get this since it was stated to have a larger hopper. It does! And the hopper is more square which is better to fit various shaped cloves.<br />Never underestimate the usefulness of the little blue cleaning tool! It is now improved- larger and fits more securely in the handle.<br />My daughters were so impressed I will be purchasing another for them.<br />After more than 10 years of flawless service and then the continued quality of this item- I'm certain this is the best press I've come across- quality materials, EASE of cleaning and ease of use.",5.0
17,"I have never been a fan of garlic presses; most take so long to properly clean, it was faster for me to chop garlic on a cutting board. But given the vast quantities of garlic my husband and I consume, I decided it was worth finding a quality press, and I chose this one based on the reviews and the price.<br /><br />Ho. Lee. Crap. The cost to awesomeness ratio on the Zyliss press is astronomical. I frickin' love this thing! Now, I don't even have to spend time peeling garlic. In fact, the press is much easier to clean if I leave the cloves unpeeled. I use a paring knife to slice the bits of chopped garlic off the press and pry the peels out. I was really impressed by how little is wasted. I get slightly less out of each clove than I would if I chopped by hand, but it's quick and easy to add another clove. I'm going to be giving these away for Christmas this year.",5.0
18,"I've used a good Oxo press for 7 years and it recently broke; I tried a few others that sucked and then splurged for the Zyliss. I've started adding fresh garlic to more dishes just because I have this press. Items that used to get a few cloves are now getting almost a full bulb just because it's so simple.<br /><br />It's true, you never have to peel the garlic and it's not even beneficial if you do. The press gets every bit of the good stuff out of the husk and the skin easily lifts out after each press. There is no waste pressed up the sides or left in the holes; the skin doesn't flop out when you open nor does it get stuck and have to be dug out. The little tool takes a couple tries to get used to but then cleans everything out easily and efficiently. It does take a bit more force to fully press the cloves than other models but that is likely due to pressing through the skin. My wife has trouble with it but she hasn't tested it with peeled cloves.",5.0
19,"My parents have a similar garlic press, different brand purchased from a local store. They had it for years and I always admired how these types of garlic presses work. I went on my hunt at local stores and no one carried this type of garlic press. The closest one I could find was from a name brand which starts with &#34;Fab...&#34;. It seemed like it could do the same. Had a larger capacity than my parents. It felt sturdy. Tried it for the first time. It failed miserably. It was only used once and after inspecting it to see if it was defective it was literally thrown away. Just poor design.<br /><br />I should've gone here first. After extensive research and reading reviews I decided to purchase the Zyliss Susi 3 Garlic Press. I love the hinge system it uses. I was extremely satisfied on the first use. Every piece of garlic went through and it literally left the skin within the holder to remove afterwards. It can fit 2-3 large garlic cloves at one time. I love this press and use it on a regular basis. It washes well and so far its been durable.",5.0
20,"This is a great product.  I'm on my second one.  First one went through the dishwasher too many times and lost it's coating.  Without the coating, raw garlic reacts with the product material turning the garlic and juice black.  Lesson learned for me.  Don't put it through the dishwasher.  Nothing does a better or faster job of quickly making macerated garlic.  No need to peel.  I recommend washing it immediately after using.  Once the garlic starts to dry, it becomes cement like- very difficult to get out.",5.0
21,Zyliss presses are great.  They convert people who think garlic pressed are a messy useless waste of time.... like me and my mother in law.,5.0
22,"If you are considering buying a garlic press, get this one.  I have owned at least 3 different garlic presses over the years, the very best of which I would have rated no higher than a 2.  The Zyliss press is made of a very rigid but lightweight body, with a tight fitting anvil which has little points to press all the flesh out of the garlic.  The net result is beautifully fine garlic puree, with almost no fiber left in the press.  The finish of the press easily releases food for easy cleaning, and the blue nylon tool that snaps inside of the handle gets those few pesky fibers out when it's time to clean up.<br /><br />It is a rare product that deserves an unqualified endorsement, but this is one of them.",5.0
23,"Having gone through several disappointing garlic presses over the years, I had given up and resorted to chopping garlic by hand.  However, with 3 kids I no longer had the luxury of time to spend chopping garlic so started searching for a garlic press.  Found this on amazon and after reading through reviews of this vs. the OXO and some of the other more popular ones, decided on this one based on price.  Love this garlic press, my mother-in-law (who had also written off garlic presses as well) used this when she was visiting last month and asked me to order one for her as well.  You can put garlic cloves in this without peeling them -- does not leave a lot of waste, just the peel is left.  No longer chopping garlic by hand, a great time saver!",5.0
24,"This was recommended to me at a cooking class.  It doesn't just smash the garlic, it really presses it through the press and you get a lot of juicy garlic.",5.0
25,"This garlic press is fantastic. It quickly minces garlic, you don't have to peel the garlic first, and it's dishwasher safe. Two regular-sized cloves or one large clove fit in the barrel. I use a toothpick to clean it; my version doesn't have the cleaning feature. Yes, the outer coating has worn off a little, but it is still a very good press. It is a little difficult to press with multiple cloves; those with arthritis would be most comfortable pressing one smaller clove at a time. Still as quick as spooning out a teaspoon from a jar, and much tastier!",5.0
26,"I have always heard about garlic crushers being handy but never tried them till i seen this one on amazon. It feels rigid, doesn't hurt the hands to use, and it can handle multiple cloves of garlic at once with no peeling done before hand. The garlic comes out very well crushed and ready for any food. The included tool works great at removing the solids left behind then a simple rinse in the sink seems to be more then enough cleaning. My family tends to love garlic in their foods so its used almost every day its been a purchase i haven't regretted but wished i had made earlier.",5.0
27,"Excellent for garlic and ginger. It is not stainless steel- I would have given if 5 stars if it were. Simple to use, the press does the pressing since it has a piece that fits over the garlic, not just you squeezing it like Oxo cheaper ones do. I was going to get the expensive one Cooks Country recommended, which looks great- but is $40 more. This used to be there best buy so I decided to try it. Very glad I did. If it gets rusty- well, for under $10 I'll order another one in a few years.",4.0
28,"Sturdy metal garlic press does a nice job; takes a little effort to squeeze, but the garlic comes out as a very fine mince which is way better than what I was doing (grating garlic on a Microplane, which can scrape your fingertips if you're not careful).  Large hopper for even the largest cloves.  The one reason I docked it one star is the plastic cleaning tool is essentially useless.  The teeth on mine never aligned with the holes; every time I used it to try and clean out the hopper, if a tooth was only slightly misaligned it would bend.  After fiddling with it and trying hopelessly to get the teeth straight again, I'm ready to toss it in the trash.  An old toothbrush works much better.",4.0
29,"If you have the hand strength this is an awesome garlic press, I do, my wife doesn't. I haven't tried to press with skin on yet, I feel it would handle smaller cloves with the skin on, I'm not sure about the bigger ones with what feels like a tree bark around them. The little cleaner thingy is more useful than I expected.",5.0
30,Bought this for my son and he has told me two times that he loves it. He reports that it fits lots of garlic and cleans easily.,5.0
31,"Really easy to use, relatively easy to clean. Brush not as helpful as I thought it would be, but moreso meaning I think it'd unnecessary--ie it's not that hard to clean in the first place. Would clean right after use, otherwise holes would be hard to get clear. We've pressed up to 4-5 cloves without cleaning out the skins/debris; but more than that and we've had to scrape it all out so that the new cloves would actually get pressed.",5.0
32,"The first time I used this, I was amazed by it's amazingness.  I am convinced that this garlic press absolutely maximizes the amount of minced garlic that you can get from each clove.  I have been using an Oneida garlic press but it does not even compare to my new Zyliss.  Worth every penny for someone who cooks and loves garlic as much as I do!  The handy cleaning tool is a big plus and I love how it fits inside the handle of the garlic press for storage but if it gets lost, you might be up a creek without a paddle.  So just don't lose the little cleaning brush and you will be very pleased with your purchase.  I do not understand the bad reviews on this product.  I cannot say it enough; I could not be happier with this garlic press.  Top quality but not as pricey as some other top rated garlic presses.  Trust me, I read a lot of reviews before biting the bullet on this one.",5.0
33,"Works like a charm! Completely presses out the garlic while leaving the shell inside the press. Thrilled with this purchase, definitely recommend!",5.0
34,"I love garlic, so I use a lot of it. Not only does this smash every little bit of the clove you put in, the cleaning brush is a god send. It snaps into place, fits every hole on it, & the long brushes on the end are perfect for pulling out the bits that are stubborn.",5.0

37,"Love the Zyliss garlic press! This is my second, and is big enough to hold BIG cloves. BUY THIS PRESS!",5.0
38,"This press is FANTASTIC.  I've probably gone thru 5 cheaper garlic presses in the past few years.  I can't believe I waited so long to purchase what I thought was so expensive for a garlic press  The Zyliss has no garlic waste, truly every drop is now used.  I do peel the outer skin first.  Ginger is pressed so intense that the left over fibers are almost dry.  So this is the best value when you take in to account the amount of product returned in garlic and ginger.  It appears to be very durable, love the built in storage/cleaning brush.  Hope it will outlive the lives of my other presses for years to come.  Even if it doesn't I'll purchase another Zyliss over any other brand.",5.0
39,"I have bought several garlic presses over my lifetime.  This is the best!  It works, and it cleans easily.",5.0
40,"I would say I love this thing, but it is still just a garlic press.  A great one.  I have had it about three weeks and used it probably 10 times.  Only once did anything squeeze out the side.  I just pushed it back in and pressed again.  Easy. Our old one would spill out every time.<br />Very easy to clean.  Paper pops out in a clean sheet.  Plastic cleaner works well.  One user complained that cleaner has to be used from far side (as opposed to the handle side). I disagree and think this is an ergonomic convenience. I hold the press in left hand and work the cleaner with right hand.  Easy.  And a three timed fork on the end of the cleaner grand the paper leftovers easily.<br />That the business part swings on a pendulum keeping it flat is a big plus.  Most other change the angle of Ttack as you close the press.<br />Would recommend to a friend.",5.0
41,"I bought this for myself about 6 months ago after the previous one lasted about a month.  This garlic press is fabulous! I can put 3 cloves of garlic in it and press it closed and it never bends out of shape.  I use this press at least 3-4 times a week.  The red cleaning tool works great, just push in in from the outside and pick out the waste.  I loved it so much that I just bought another one to give as a gift!",5.0
42,"It is a little larger than my previous Zyliss Garlic Press, which gives it the plus of being able to press more cloves at a time, and the minus of making it more difficult to press if you do. I always press my garlic unpeeled, and use the tip of a sharp knife to pull out the remains from the press, so I find I do not use the handy little blue plastic cleaning attachment. It tends to fall out of the handle when you are pressing garlic anyway. The only reason I do not give it five stars is because dishwasher use is not recommended. I did anyway, with my old one, and the finish finally buckled, necessitating this purchase. I'm washing this one by hand.",4.0
43,"I love this garlic press!  Who would have thought it!  It is much smaller and lighter than our previous (oxo) - so yay for more space in the drawer.  But what I couldn't believe was how little garlic is left behind.  This sucker presses ALL the garlic through!  I'm used to having a fair amount of it left behind, that I then have to throw out.  With this press, you can barely tell you've had anything in it at all.  The brush makes clean up easier, but most of the garlic left comes out if you rinse it.",5.0
44,"The finish on my old Zyliss garlic press eventually wore off after 35 years of use, leaving a black stain on my hands and garlic, so I had to break down and get a new one. I chose the larger style because my old one would only press portions of a clove at a time, so I was interested in something that could accommodate more volune at a time. The handles are a bit large for my smaller hands, but not as problematic as some reviewers indicate. If this one lasts as long as my old one did, I will be very happy. And I also like the built in cleaning head. Very handy.",5.0

47,"So nice to have a garlic press again, its been too long. Easy to use and clean. Don't listen to haters that think garlic crushers are a waste of space and money. I was like that for a long time.

53,"I have broken 2 garlic presses where the actual garlic press is metal, but the handle is plastic.  When the handle is plastic, it is so easy to break when you press hard on the garlic.<br /><br />PROS:<br />(1) Strong Handles.  The entire contraption is metal so when you press the garlic very hard, this is much more durable than other garlic presses.<br />(2) Hole Cleaner.  Getting the garlic peel out of the press can be annoying and make you hands smell like garlic for the rest of the day, but this has a nifty plastic hold cleaner that cleans the holes and keeps your hand clean.<br />(3) Large Basket.  This press is large enough to hold multiple cloves and press at the same time.<br /><br />CONS:<br />(1) Although the basket is large, if you press more than one clove, the peel can block up the holes and make it difficult to thoroughly press all the cloves.  This will be the case with any garlic press though.  I wouldn't press more than one clove at a time.",5.0
54,Excellent garlic press.  I had a Susi years ago that got lost.  I tried another brand and was very unhappy.  So I went back to Susi.  Will never buy another brand again.  But I shouldn't have to unless I lose this one too.  It's very well made.  Does an excellent job and is easy to clean.  I love the little red &#34;brush&#34; for help cleaning.  Everything about this press is great.,5.0
55,"This garlic press is a huge upgrade from my previous model, which was stamped steel with a removable basket.  The tolerances are much tighter and the nubs on the plunger hold the garlic, so almost all the garlic ends up crushed, instead of squeezing out around the plunger.<br /><br />As some have mentioned, it is easiest to clean immediately after use.  When I forget or am lazy, I just soak the whole press for a few minutes and then it's easy to clean again (the garlic residue softens).  I haven't broken the cleaning tool yet, but I could see how it would be easy if you forced it in backwards (the pattern is not fore/aft symmetric!) or got excited while using the 3 tooth end.  It will still be an awesome press if/when the tool breaks, I'll just be using toothpicks to clean it.",5.0
56,"I use lots of fresh garlic.  Daily. Luckily, at my local grocery they offer cute little plastic baskets filled with garlic cloves that have been cleaned, so all I have to do is pop one or two of those babies into my cool Zyliss Garlic Press and I'm ready to roll.<br /><br />Before my Zyliss, I had several different garlic presses that I picked from, willy nilly, from the kitchen tool drawer.  One was easy to squeeze, but hard to clean.  Another one was creaky and stiff, made my hand hurt if I didn't cut the clove into parts before filling its bin for pressing.  A third was trendy and did a terrible job, the only time I used it was when I fell prey to how techno it looks and stupidly thought that maybe this time, things would be different.  They never were, and I should just toss that one out - but I won't, because it's so artsy.<br /><br />It's as if I had been dating, and suddenly met The One.<br /><br />The Zyliss fits easily into my hand, and I can squeeze without hardship.  This is true, even if I put several garlic cloves into its bin at the same time.  Lovely.<br /><br />The Zyliss also has a fabulous cleaner that makes the press extremely easy to clean.  Shoves the mess right up and out, no need to worry about getting the grit out of those tiny little holes.  Nice.<br /><br />Finally, the Zyliss is light as a feather, or close to it.  It's sturdy without anchoring your wrist down while you're working.<br /><br />Problems with it?  Very few.  I've almost lost the cleaner once or twice since it is separate from the press itself.  That would be a nightmare if it went missing.  I'd have to buy another Zyliss asap.<br /><br />I recommend this product - as well as using fresh garlic!<br /><br />- Reba Kennedy",5.0
57,This is probably one of the very few Garlic Press that I have not broken. I've always been a fan of Zyliss and I must say they put a lot of time and effort into making the best products.  I initially bought a few different garlic press over the span of 6 months and broke them all.  They were all cheaply made by different manufacturers.  I've been able to use the Zyliss without any issues.  It literally does the job for you with one press. Very nice design and a handy garlic press.,5.0

When my daughter got married my wife graciously gave our susi to her. I bought another brand for us that seemed very well built, but it didn't do a very good job. I tossed it in the trash one day in frustration ... and ordered the ""susi 2"".  It's a bit bigger and can crush garlic without peeling it. It works flawlessly... don't ask me how Zyliss does it, they just do. I read a few reviews that stated it did not come with a tool to clean the press ... it certainly does ... it's neatly tucked away in the handle .... good job Zyliss.",5.0
61,I have 5 garlic presses and I have been searching for the best one. I had one that I got from target that I loved but the plastic handle broke (from over use). It had very similar design as this one. After it broke I have been looking for a replacement and so far they have all sucked until now. I am so excited to use this garlic press because it actually presses out garlic-all the other ones just smashed my garlic and only a little bit of garlic would make it thru the press. I love this one!,5.0
62,"This is an excellent garlic press.  It doesn't look as heavy-duty as some of the others I've seen, and it's not nearly as expensive as some, which worried me when I first bought it.  But now that I've had it for over a year, it's been exceptionally durable, and very usable.  It's made out of high quality materials, and its design does a great job of pushing all the garlic through, and leaving very little pulp/fiber behind.  It's also easier to clean out than any other press I have experience with.  I've kept it out of the dishwasher, so I don't know how it would stand up to that.  Highly recommended.",5.0
63,"I could not wait until I could replace my old stainless garlic press with something that was functional and easily cleaned after every use.  I read several reviews on different presses and based on the Zyliss reviews, I purchased the Zyliss.  I use garlic almost daily and this is a very simple and easy press to use; no need to peel cloves, just put them in the press whole.  It is large enough to press two cloves at a time and clean up is a cinch with the built in cleaner.  It attaches to the press so you cannot lose it in the drawer.",99
64,"This thing works very well. My recommendation is that you clean out the garlic immediately with the red brush or else it'll try and become harder to clean later. Also, it works best if you scrape it out in between every clove, as the skin will start to create a barrier that affects the garlic coming through the holes. It will technically work if you don't but not as well.",4.0
65,This is a kitchen item I would not be without. I have use it (or previous versions) every day for at least ten years and it is just so well DESIGNED. The garlic is minced perfectly without the need to peel the clove first. The dry outer part of the clove comes out of the holes easily if you open the handle straight away. If it dries in there you will need to use the plastic &#34;hedgehog&#34; that comes with it to clear the holes.<br /><br />I've tried many garlic presses that only just work or work badly. This one is a joy to use because it works so well.,5.0
66,It has a large compartment for multiple cloves and requires minimal effort to press. The brush is somewhat helpful but doesn't clean out completely. I use tooth pick. I recommend peeling before pressing anyway to avoid the mess and wasting garlic in the separation process.,4.0

Peeling takes forever, you have to be careful cutting (my main knife is a Togiharu, and it has required me to get stitches...), and if you use a garlic press they just refuse to clean. The Zyliss Jumbo Garlic Press has solved all of my problems.

I really don't need to peel garlic cloves any more; I just pop 'em in (two or three at a time, if they'll fit) and squeeze.  The residue comes right out, and I'm squeezing more.

You don't have to remove the skin, but it would help if doing several cloves.  The blue cleaner in the handle does pop out probably because that is where I put pressure on it, but that does not bother me as I am so very satisfied with this press that I want to add garlic in almost everything I make!  Cleans great and the mince is perfect.  As the saying goes, you get what you pay for and this little charmer is worth every penny.",5.0

I owned a garlic press before and the Zyliss beats it flatout every way. I hardly ever used the other one. The Zyliss gets regular use in our hosehold, primarily since it's easy to clean. The included blue jammer-thing squeezes all the leftover clogged garlic bits out and can be used to jiggle the remaining bits as well with the other end. Can be used to press ginger and other similar roots as well and even presses unpeeled garlic cloves. Overall, a great device, if you feel you could benefit from a garlic press, the Zyliss is what you want.",5.0
79,"Love this garlic press - maybe the best we've had!  It's strong enough to just put the garlic into without peeling or snipping off the end.  However, it's powerful enough that the hard bits get sent through too - so it's better to snip the end off.  Inside the handle of the press is a little cleaner that is so handy.  We never put this into the dishwasher since that tends to take the finish off of these things.  But with a quick flick of the cleaner and warm water rinse, this keeps it clean enough.",5.0

I can press a couple extra large  un peeled cloves at once with a fairly high level of hand strength, it's easier with 2 xl peeled or chopped cloves and still easier with one large or or 2 chopped normal cloves. It requires more strength than I anticipated and more than my wife can reasonably handle for the jumbo garlic we mostly use.<br />Easy to clean under running water scraped by a finger nail, followed by a quick hard expelled breath the wrong way thru it.<br />A little mushed garlic will  usually creep past the plunger when an xl  clove or two are processed.<br />I've ordered a Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press hoping my wife can handle it.",4.0

When they eventually did I ordered it the very same day and have not minced a clove of garlic by hand since (almost a year now).<br /><br />This press can easily handle any type of garlic you throw at it.  I press garlic without the paper, my wife does it with the paper and either way it works the same.

Even so, you can easily order replacement cleaners directly from Zyliss for very little.<br /><br />Overall this is a great garlic press.

It crushes with ease, no peeling required! The attached cleaning tool makes cleaning a breeze.<br /><br />The only flaw I will mention is that the coating on the press can be easily scratched.

118,This works great with garlic peeled or not.  You can fill it to the brim with cloves and it will still crush although obviously it'll take more pressure.  Easily contains all but monster sized cloves.  If you don't peel the garlic the debris comes out quite easily.  I generally peel & trim cloves and just keep crushing until I'm done with the batch and then pop out the debris from the last.  Supposedly garlic has most of it's nutrients and flavor in the outer shell (skin) so tossing the debris each time isn't the way to go.<br /><br />Cleaning note: if you rinse with hot water immediately after use then you are basically done cleaning and don't need the cleaner attachment.

134,"I had another garlic press that was truly awful.  Half of the garlic wouldn't come out.  I ordered this one in hopes that it would press the entire clove of garlic, and it does!  I would definitely recommend it.  Some might criticize that it's hard to clean out, but you'd have the same problem no matter what press you use.  It cleans pretty easily actually.  I would buy it again.  I've had it for about 6 months and still works great!",5.0
135,"I really like this. I have read some complaining about paint coming off - It has with mine, but paint passes through your digestive tract as an inert item. I like the blue thingy that allows you to clean the press holes. It stores in the handle. Really well thought out product.",5.0
136,I haven't used a garlic press in a while due to how hard they were and how hard it was to clean them. I usually just throw the whole clove into whatever I'm making but someone recommended this so I thought I would try it and I'm glad I did. It's very easy to use and cleans well with the blue attachment. Makes my food a lot tastier.,5.0

138,"This is our second Zyliss. The first lasted about five years with constant - just about daily - use. (The grating broke through.)<br />It can handle large, unpeeled cloves easily, as well as several smaller cloves at once. Cleaning is a snap and<br />the grate cleaning tool is always handy - it snaps into the handle. A simple and very tough tool, stronger than most. I've tried others<br />that did not last very long. Completely un-fussy to use.",5.0
139,"I love this press!  I would easily order two!  The clean up brush is a great feature and it's easy to store.  I was a little skeptical because, eh it's a garlic press, what can you expect?  But this thing will be with us for a lifetime.  You can put the clove in, unpeeled, and it squeezes most of the pulp out.",5.0
140,Works & looks great. Nice to have the brush/cleaner built in. Saves time by not requiring peeling.<br /><br />I bought this item at full price with no involvement from the supplier or any review agency.,4.0
141,"Best garlic press I've owned.  I saw the Zyliss 2 in action at my brother's house.  I was amazed at how much more of the garlic it was able to press than my jenky one (don't know the company).  The old one has been relegated to the back of my utensil drawer and this is amazing.  You don't have to pre-peel the cloves, but I've found by giving it a good crush with the side of the knife then putting it in the press, there's barely anything left behind!  Great buy!",5.0
142,"This is a great garlic press! No more peeling the clove, just pop it in and squeeze. Lot and lots of nice mashed garlic on the other end, just perfect for salad dressings, garlic bread or recipes. Comes with a spiky plastic thingy to to clean it out, but I prefer to just use a small fork to get the skin out before I pop in another clove, then rinse it under hot water. The press survives the dishwasher nicely.<br /><br />Anything that reduces the mess and makes a kitchen process easier is aces in my book.",5.0
143,"I never would have thought that I would love a garlic press, but this one is amazing.<br />I actually use it to mince ginger as well - a little fibrous pad is all that is left on the inside after pressing.<br /><br />The press is easy to use and clean, mine came with a blue plastic cleaning tool that kinda fits in the handle (one of the places that the Susi 3 is better).<br /><br />This was the best garlic press that I'd ever used until I used the Suzi 3 - which is a little larger, the hopper is a little tighter, and the cleaning tool attaches to the handle better.",5.0
144,"I'm not thrilled with cooking, so buying a garlic press at this price was uncharacteristic for me.  But I love garlic and I hate trying to chop it.  I've had cheaper garlic presses, but they were a royal pain in the rear to clean and didn't work as well.  This thing is the bomb.  It presses every last bit of the clove, leaving just the skin, and it's very easy to clean.",5.0
145,Excellent,5.0
146,"Best one I have ever used. The cleaning tool is super convenient and fits nicely inside so will not get lost. I'm a huge OXO fan however for this garlic press, OXO can't hold a candle to the Zyliss",5.0
147,"I cook with garlic a lot, but my least favorite thing about garlic presses in general is cleaning them out. The scrubber for this thing makes it so much easier. To use it, just throw the unpeeled clove in, smash it, toss out the peel, and repeat.",5.0
148,"I heard about this on America's Test Kitchen<br /><br />Things I like<br /><br />1. can press one or two (depending on size) heads of garlic unpeeled<br />2. cleans easily with cleaner<br />3. cleaner stores easily in handle (helps keep it from getting lost<br />4. cleaner is designed not only to clean out the holes but also the ""hopper""<br /><br />Things on the not so great side<br /><br />Unpeeled cloves take a lot of pressure to push through and not all of the garlic makes it out of the hopper (to solve this and improve function I cut the top of the clove off still much quicker than trying to peal the whole clove)<br /><br />Overall very happy and a big improvement over previous garlic presses",99
149,"I love it.  My neighbor loaned me her Pampered Chef for a couple of days while this was en route.  I learned that the Zyliss is easily as good as what some consider &#34;the best&#34;.  I don't rely on the attached cleaning tool, though.  It's very simple to tap a kitchen brush onto the holes & use a little paring knife to pop off the piece of skin.  You definitely do not need to peel the clove before pressing, but you do take the hard end off with a paring knife.  Wonderful product!",5.0
150,"I bought this to replace a fancy-looking stainless steel press I bought at Target a few years ago. That press was no good because it left half the garlic in the press. This press effectively pushes out almost all the garlic, and I love how large it is -- I can easily fit to big cloves or several small ones. When it's full like that it can be a little hard to squeeze (I'm a petite woman will small hands), but I've never not been able to do it. I always peel the garlic first to make sure I get as much out as possible. It's pretty easy to clean, though I do worry a little about losing the blue cleaner attachment.",5.0
151,"we had the the susi 2 for a long time and just thought it was time for a new one... so for a year or so we went out and bought numerous different presses and were disappointed with most of them, the ones that did work just worked ok.<br />so I went online and started to do some research on garlic presses and concluded that this was the best one and I have to say when I got it I was very impressed! it works way better than the susi 2.",5.0
152,"This is a great garlic press.  We go through a lot of garlic in our house and this has a good solid hand feel. My wife commented immediately that it was easier to use than the two that came before it. I wouldn't recommend placing the garlic cloves in with the skin intact, you lose some of the garlic that way, but if you put them in peeled it's a quick push to finish it off.  Cleaning is also easy with the attached cleaner, that's really helpful.",5.0
153,"I bought mine a couple years ago and I love it.  I have read some negative reviews about the coating peeling off and I have never had this problem at all and I use it every week.  I usually peel the garlic before I put it in the press, so I don't know how well it works if you don't peel it first.  You definitely need some strength in your hands to use this, so I can see it being difficult for some people. I never used any other garlic press so I don't know if they are easier to press.  I think the matte finish is better to prevent slippage with wet hands.",5.0
154,Have had this press for 2 years now and it is still going strong. It's change the way I approach garlic in my cooking and couldn't live without it (I move a lot and have transported it to three different countries with me). It even comes with a plastic brush to clean the holes easily.,5.0
155,"Years ago I saw this product being used on a cooking show and they called the best garlic press ever. So I brought it and never regretted the purchase.

Broke the handle on my Calphalon press of more than 10 years (the handle was made of two separate materials, and it broke in between); then warped a cheap grocery-store garlic press on the first use. Naturally gravitated to this press with a sturdy, one-piece handle--and this one delivers. Easily smashes all the garlic meat out of a peeled clove, and cleans up like a dream. Love the built-in cleaner.",5.0

It holds more garlic (I had to cut the cloves in the old one) and garlic container is hinged to the press rather than falling out all the time like many designs.  I liked the design enough to order three.  One for my son, one to replace mine and one for my daughter.  We are all pleased.",5.0

It's molded out of two pieces of metal, with no junctions or screwed together pieces (unlike some competitor products), so it's easy to clean and there are no junctions or nooks and crannies where dirt can collect.  Zyliss has some of the best design for kitchen utensils, and this is no exception.",5.0

Very little waste, can handle large cloves, cleaning tool is handy and stows in the handle so it doesn't get lost in the drawer. I have small hands so get the easiest results by (mostly) peeling the cloves and doing just one or two at a time; my husband has no problem pressing several unpeeled cloves at once. Have been hand-washing it so haven't had any peeling finish issues. Was initially concerned a ""jumbo"" press would be clunky to store, but this isn't that large overall and I really appreciate the larger hopper.",4.0

178,"I got this one because the press aligns with the holes so more of my garlic actually gets pressed through. I also like the little plastic part that removes any extra that gets stuck in it.

I don't have to worry about that happening with this one.",5.0

Also the cleaner thing broke pretty quickly, but I find if you do it right away, it cleans very easily.",4.0
184,Zyliss has the best design for a garlic press.  I've used other designs and they either lasted for less than a year or didn't do a decent job.  This garlic press has done an excellent job.

I highly recommend this product.,5.0

It does everything a garlic press should do, and with style. Unlike some other presses and ricers I've had in the past, the handle is comfortable and the motion is easy.

I have read that some people have had problems with the non-stick coating peeling off, but I hope to avoid that by washing this baby by hand. It has made working with garlic SO much easier! I recommend this garlic press without reservation!<br /><br />UPDATE-3/5/2013: It broke! I've owned it for about two months and used it a dozen times at the most. Tonight, I was pressing a clove of garlic and I heard a snap. There are two small bars that hold the part that actually presses the garlic to the handle. Both of those bars simply snapped. A product that I initially loved turned out to be not so durable.  I'm going to see how the manufacturer handles this and I'll give another update later. If they stand by their product I'll leave my five-star rating and assume I got a bad one. If they don't, I'll have to drastically reduce my rating. We shall see...<br /><br />UPDATE-3/6/2013: I sent an email last night to the manufacturer with a picture of the broken press and a copy of my purchase receipt.

235,"I had an older Susi press, but even though it worked fairly well, it was small and couldn't handle larger cloves of garlic.  I bought this press after reading the recommendations from America's Test Kitchen, and it was a great recommendation.  This thing can do a lot of garlic in a short time and it's much easier to clean than the smaller presses.<br /><br />One other thing I love about this press is the fact that the cleaning tool stashes right in the handle.  It doesn't get buried in a drawer where I have to go digging for it.<br /><br />I wish I had bought mine sooner!",5.0
236,Works great and is super easy to clean. Don't even need to put it in the dishwasher after I use it! All the garlic comes out cleanly with the little brush. Great buy.,5.0
237,"This is a fabulous garlic press.  You can put the entire clove in the box, with skin and root.  When you press it through, only the meat of the garlic comes through.  You can fairly easily clean the skin and root out with the plastic tool inside the press.",5.0
238,"Bought this press to replace a cheap one I bought in the grocery store (it was red and the paint started to come off - not good!).  This press is a work horse - sturdy and easy to use.  The cleaner gadget that comes with it is great and ensures the press is thoroughly cleaned each time.  I've had it for several months, use it frequently and have no problems with it at all.  On the contrary, it is holding up just great with no signs of wear at all.",5.0
239,"Works exactly as described.  This press makes 'mincing' garlic so much quicker!  I used to cut up each clove individually (which is very time consuming, especially with large recipes) but this device makes multiple cloves 'minced' in just seconds.  Kinda hard to clean up though, especially if left overnight and garlic dries up inside the housing.",4.0
240,This makes product makes it a joy to mine garlic.  My old garlic press had broken and trying to cut the garlic with a knife was just not working out.  The Zyliss garlic press is easy to use and clean.  The brush that comes with the press makes the cleaning a breeze.  We are very happy with this garlic press.,5.0
241,"I love this garlic press.  I had a really cheap one prior to this, but because I cook with a lot of garlic I finally had to ditch it.  I bit the bullet and bought one that was a little more pricey and it was totally worth it.  I can press more garlic at once, I can get more garlic out of each clove and clean up is a snap!",5.0
242,The cast aluminum feels very sturdy. Easy to clean (for a garlic press).  I'm glad I paid a premium for it!<br />Often I overstuff the press and it holds up just fine.,5.0
243,"I had almost given up on mincing my own garlic, because the garlic press I had been using worked so poorly.  This Zyliss garlic press has restored my faith in garlic presses.  I can not believe how much pulp comes out of this press.  It gives me all the meat and leaves only the paper-thin skin behind.  Very fun to use!  Very solid construction.  I would recommend this press to anyone!",5.0

245,"For the price and design this is the best. We bought this to replace our old Zyliss and they've made several design improvements over the years. They make a durable, very well designed product. It presses garlic completely through the press, and the handles don't bend when you squeeze them together like many garlic presses. The cleaner that slides into the handle makes it super easy to clean.",5.0

She told me it is useful and really saves her time, she loves it!",5.0

I've used this twice and love it.  It takes some muscle to get garlic through it, but the extra flavor and blend in the food is well worth it.  It's strong, sturdy, easy to use and comes with its own cleaning tool.  And, as always, Amazon's fast shipping is an added plus.",5.0
253,"I wanted to make adding garlic to many of my meals easier since it is a flavorful, low-cal addition. This press makes it easy, and it has a special brush that makes cleaning it also very efficient. Really like this press, the grip, and the quality of the workmanship. Plus I got it the day after I ordered it!",5.0
254,Simply the best garlic crusher around.  I crush onions and ginger in it too.  You can lighten the force of squeezing by putting less in it.  So there is nothing to complain about in that department.  The blue cleaning thing is pretty cool too although I don't need it everytime I clean it.,5.0
255,"I recently bought it, and have used it only a couple of times. All you do is place the garlic clove inside and squeeze - it seems to work without removing the hard outside skin, as this skin stays inside the cavity. A brief rinse under the faucet appears to clean it pretty good. It is quite a timesaver over peeling and dicing the garlic yourself",5.0

258,"This was bought for two reasons. It would accomadate more volume and it has a pin device to match the holes in the press for cleanup.<br />The cleanup device is great and becoming an invaluable asset.<br />The larger volume cup cannot be used by my wife since she is not strong enough to compress the larger amounts. So, she generally only presses one or two garlic pieces.",4.0
259,"easy to wash, my only gripe with this is that, it is not very strong. so if you put in huge cloves of garlic, you need alot of strength. and that means that with the extra exertion, garlic might fly elsewhere other than into the bowl of something. good for use with small cloves and big cloves that have been halved. still saves me alot of time compared to normal cutting and chopping it up",4.0
260,"this garlic press trumps any other I have had before. It's well finished and presses garlic so well.<br /><br />Very little waste, little sips through the sides and the grid is easy to clean with a little plastic tool that clicks perfectly in the handle.<br /><br />Note : always clean your garlic press after use... dried garlic is a pain to clean.",5.0

The stowable cleaning tool is great, just remember to pull it out before using the press, or there's a risk of it falling out into your cooking. Seems well built, and should last for quite a long time.",4.0
263,"I have to admit that I've never owned a high quality garlic press, but this thing is excellent. Used it last night for the first time and I think that I got every bit of usable garlic out of it. I did peel the garlic first, so there was virtually nothing left in the press. It is well-worth the reasonable price.",5.0

Knocking the skin off by banging the clove with the flat side of my chefs knive against the cutting board is so easy, why wouldn't you?<br /><br />More importantly, the quality of the garlic flavor in the recipe is much greater than hand mincing! I made the mistake of buying the OXO press and am so glad that it broke (after only one year!) because buying the Zyliss was a vast improvement.",5.0

276,This is one of the best garlic presses I have ever had.  I love that the bottom is flat so you can run a knife accross the bottom.  I had a different press that had a removeable basket and you could never get the knife close enough and I was always wasting garlic. This can take several normal size cloves. It is great.,5.0

281,"I've been suffering for too long with an overpriced, underachieving Cutco garlic press that was a sympathy purchase from my son's friend who was trying to make a living. It's such a pleasure to now have a press that actually performs the job well.. and so effortlessly. I've only used it once (for several cloves), so can't speak to its longevity. But I'm definitely pleased with its premiere performance.<br /><br />Update July 1, 2012: Three years later, it's still going strong. Looks and performs like new.",5.0
282,I've always heard how nice garlic presses are.  Unfortunately my old one didn't lead me to believe that.  This is the best purchase I've made for the kitchen in awhile!

Well received.",5.0

295,"I still prefer the original Susi, but it is no longer made. This one has a non stick finish which I don't really see as necessary. The holes clog a bit more than the original, but the attached pokey thing takes care of cleaning them out. I will say that I keep the pokey thing on the sink counter, because it always pops out when I squeeze the garlic press. The hopper is large and can hold 2 to 3 cloves of garlic at one time. I would never put it in the dishwasher; just rinse out right after use and there is no problem.",4.0
296,"This garlic press works great.  No problem pressing the garlic with the skins left on. The tool provided for cleaning is interesting and works well.

This Zyliss jumbo garlic press is just what is needed to do the job on large garlic cloves or even several small to medium size cloves when you find them. This garlic press is easy to operate and you don't even need to peel the garlic before pressing. A cleaning tool is also included. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,99

I never grate ginger anymore, I just put it through the press.<br /><br />The finish is smooth, feels good to use and requires less force than many other presses.<br />Cleanup really is easy, although the picture of someone using the cleaning tool actually shows them using it in the wrong orientation.<br />The cleanup tool snaps into the handle more effectively than I've seen before, and is therefore less likely to get lost.<br /><br />I used to have a Susi 2, which I loved, but this is an even better garlic press.  The hopper is larger than the Susi 2's and the plunger has a slightly tighter fit.  Almost nothing squeezes out around the plunger.  Also, the cleaning tool is held more securely in the Susi 3.",5.0

Like others have mentioned, the biggest cloves fit in without issue (every bit of garlic is pressed out) leaving the skin as the lone item to clean. The skin usually slides out without issue but should there be any remainder the handy tool (stored in the handle) takes care of it. Be careful to align the prongs on the tool correctly or you'll bend them, making subsequent cleaning difficult.<br /><br />This is a great gift idea for people who have been using the old school inefficient garlic presses that are often more trouble than they're worth. After I pressed my first clove I walked over to the trash can and threw out my cheapie.",5.0

612,"Update: I used this for about 2 years consistently. It still does a good job, but the small cleaning part got lost during a move. After all this time some of the metal paint on the sides started scraping and showing wear, but that only affected it aesthetically. The reason why I dock a star after all this time is because the cleaning bristles do start to warp and it's not as easy to quickly clean it when the two don't mesh properly.<br /><br />Old: I've had this for over a month now and I use it often in the kitchen. With this I am able to easily put garlic into just about anything whenever I want. Works awesome for soups, marinades, sautes, and just about anything else.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to use. Just pop in a garlic clove or two and squeeze the handles. You don't have to trim the ends of your garlic or anything.<br />Easy to clean. Just open the press, use the cleaning utensil to poke out the leftover crushed garlic, then run under water. You may want to rinse the whole thing to make sure you get all the garlic out.<br />The garlic press is made of metal, so it feels durable and sturdy.<br /><br />Con: You do need some hand strength. The larger the garlic clove or the more cloves you put in the more difficult it may be to squeeze the handles together.<br />It has to be hand washed, BUT it's easy to wash by hand anyway.<br />The little cleaning utensil is probably the weakest part, and since it's plastic I worry about it warping in the future. Though, with proper care and keeping it away from intense heat it should be fine.<br /><br />I would definitely suggest this for anyone who loves to use fresh garlic, but doesn't want to waste the time trimming and chopping all those little cloves.",4.0

I did not even peel the knob of ginger and it extracted all  the juice and pulp. leaving behind just the outer skin.  The only negative is the attached cleaning tool is not very durable.  The plastic pins bend easily and cannot be straightened.  Oh well, just a little inconvenience.",4.0
683,It handles both traditional and cut up elephant cloves with ease without squirting stuff out the top like a kitchen aid press I previously had.

705,"I am a petite woman with small hands and just average grip strength.  I assumed this was why I could never find a garlic press that worked for me...until now!  I got this press in the mail today so I just had to encorporate some garlic into dinner tonight to try it out.  Much to my family's surprise, I popped in a large garlic clove without peeling it first (a true test), and gave it a squeeze.  Not only was it easy to squeeze, ALL of the garlic came out of the press!  Nothing oozed up around the sides of the plunger.  All that was left was the empty husk which came out easily with just a finger grab.  I imagine if you had large fingers, you might want to use the cleaner that is cleverly stored in the handle of the press.  I tried it again with the same results.  The hopper is really not big enough to accomodate more than one or two cloves, but it works so quickly, I don't see that as a problem.  Cleanup was a matter of simply running the press under water.  I'm amazed!  My whole family is amazed!  I hope this garlic press lasts forever (it does seem very sturdy and appears to be made of a cast aluminum, and on another website that I found it does say that it is made of Aluminium and Stainless Steel, and that the non-stick coating is Ilaflon).  I considered giving it one less star for being made in China, but this seems to be a really good product. No regrets so far!",5.0
706,"We received a Zyliss Garlic press as a wedding present 39 years ago.  They work great, They clean up easily. This model is easier to use than the old one, It has more leverage for old tired hands.  Buy one- You won't be sorry.",4.0
707,"When our OXO garlic press, an older version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-one/dp/B00004OCJX"">this one</a>, broke after more than a decade of service, we started shopping around. The OXO was *alright*, but not great, so we decided to go with a different brand. After a couple of weeks of use, we're really pleased with the Zyliss Susi 3. It makes short work of garlic cloves, and clean up is pretty easy. (Garlic presses are always annoying to clean, but this one isn't too bad, even though you have to do it by hand since it's not really dishwasher-safe.)<br /><br />We were definitely tempted by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kuhn-Rikon-Epicurean/dp/B0000CD0HX"">Kuhn Rikon Epicurean</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/R-ouml-sle-12782/dp/B000063Y8F"">R&ouml;sle 12782</a>&nbsp;garlic presses, but we didn't feel like spending forty or more dollars on something.

708,"Updated: I contacted the company about my original press breaking, and they promptly sent me a replacement after I sent a picture of the broken item.  So I'm upgrading to 5 starts for customer service.<br /><br />Pros: This garlic press is a breeze to use.  Cloves do not need to be peeled before they are pressed, and the hopper can easily handle one large or several small cloves.  The garlic comes out with a nice, fine mince.  Unlike other presses I've used, the zyliss does a good job of extracting most of the garlic from the clove, and most of the garlic passes through the holes rather than squeezing up around the sides of the plunger.  The only time I've had issues with garlic &#34;escaping&#34; around the sides is when I overload the press.  The zyliss comes with a tool that makes picking out the spent garlic skins and cleaning the press about as easy as it gets for a garlic press, and all the parts rinse clean easily.<br /><br />Cons: It does take a little bit of strength to use - I sometimes find myself taking out a clove if I put in multiples at once because I'm not able to get enough force to squish all of them.  I've never had problems with crushing a clove if I do one at a time, but it may not be easy to use for someone with low grip strength.  Also, a previous version of this press (with the blue cleaning tool) did not last for very long - the hinge that holds the plunger to the handle broke, so the plunger had to be re-positioned with each use.  So I will be waiting to see how well this edition hold up.  However, the press worked well enough that I did buy the new model as a replacement - I initially purchased a different press, and found it was much more frustrating to use, so came back to the Zyliss.",5.0
709,"This press works well, but not as life-changing ('no peeling! no smashing cloves! no wasting garlic juice!') as expected. Why? 1--If you don't pre-peel the cloves, skin accumulates quickly and clogs the holes; so every couple cloves or so you have to stop to dig out this fibrous-filmy membrane of smashed skin--it's annoying, fingers get garlicky, etc. 2--Bits of lovely smashed garlic still manage to get stuck in the crevices and holes and refuse to go into the pan, unmovable (except by unreasonable amounts of banging and/or digging out). There's definitely some garlic juice wastage. 3--Kind of a pain to clean. The brush  helps, but even if you run it under hot water immediately after use, everything is still a bit garlicky... By the time you've popped the brush out of the handle, poked the holes clean (first with the short dense bristles, then the three long bristles on the other end--and don't think you don't need to do both, both functions included for a reason!), and dug into the corners, you may as well have just handwashed several knives. (And I usually just dishwash mine like a philistine, so this is even more time lost for me.) And then I -still- feel compelled to run it through the dishwasher--if not every use, at least every other use, lest the garlicky buildup set in and get sticky over time.<br /><br />I'm a fairly proficient home cook--after years of eschewing &#34;unitaskers&#34; Alton Brown-style, it was an article on NYMag's Strategist that swayed me. The writer, a prominent NY chef, promised it was utilitarian, non-gimmicky, a kitchen essential; and I was tired of suffering occasional semi-dry garlic (bane of sporadic home cooks everywhere) that tasted unsatisfying even after the classic smash-then-fine-mince. True, this press lets me access every bit of garlicky taste in my shriveled clove. But I'm not a pro chef, and I'm not regularly going through bowls of garlic (that are pre-peeled by an assiduous underling), so for me this is not a &#34;kitchen essential.&#34;<br /><br />So I'll keep this; I'll enjoy it; I'll especially appreciate it when I'm just sauteeing pre-washed spinach straight out of the carton in garlic, olive oil, pepper and salt (in which case, yay for no knives/cutting boards). But my life is still an imperfect thing, fraught with sticky fingers and much garlic poking.",4.0
710,"I have fibromyalgia which effects anything I do with my hands, like grating garlic or ginger, which I use every day in an Amish concoction for my hypertension.... this had been such a pain. After getting the Zyliss though it's a breeze. I pop two or three small cloves of garlic (only cut off the very tips of the ends) and then squeeze. The garlic pops out on the outer side and leaves the hull in a neat little packed thing so I can most of the time just pull it out in one go. Then to clean it I use the little red brush (mostly the 3 little prongs) the trick is to punch from the outside rather than the inside (which seems intuitive but doesn't work as well) A quick rinse as I am punching and then I dry it off thoroughly which doesn't take any time, then I cut a piece of ginger, use a spoon to peel it and pop it in the holder, squeeze and voila. Getting the ginger remains is not as easy as the garlic but it is still pretty easy. With the ginger punch the hole from the outside then use the 3 prongs to pick out the hull part, in most cases it sticks to the prongs. Overall if this were to break I would buy another one for sure.",5.0
711,"Please note: I am no chef so I do not have extensive knowledge of many kitchen utensils. But I do love to cook with garlic and have used my fair share of garlic presses.<br /><br />One of the last presses I owned was one of those heavy, chrome-plated numbers with the big soft EZ-grip handles. It may have been easy to grip but it was a mess to clean, even after I peeled the garlic--which was a requirement to use this thing. But I dealt with it because, hey! it's kind of fancy and probably top-of-the-line, and cleaning out garlic pulp with a toothpick was just a fact of life that every garlic lover had to endure.<br /><br />Then it broke. And for a time we were reduced to smashing our garlic like Neanderthals. That is until *this* little baby went on sale.<br /><br />When I received it, it didn't feel particularly solid. But it was on sale and eh... I'm pressing garlic, not walnuts. I did appreciate at the fact that I didn't need to peel the garlic, saving me more than a few seconds of prep, fumbling with the garlic skin like I was one of those 'before' videos in late night infomercial.<br /><br />However the real fun came with the cleaning: using the red garlic peel pokey-brush-thingie, the skin and mess all came out in one fell swoop! Any remaining tiny bits were easily dispatched with the skinnier pokey handle-end-thingie! And this magical little item is always at hand as it tucks happily away in the handle, ready to be popped out in a moment's notice! You do usually have to clean after every clove--and I always use more garlic. But the little red thingie is always at hand, waiting to scrub away another sticky peel.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy to use. Time spent removing garlic skin would be better spent pouring wine.<br />- Easy to clean. Let me say there's something aesthetically pleasing using the garlic brush-a-mabob and getting those little bristles into all the little holes. It's like the bubble wrap of doing dishes.<br />- The brush-a-mabob itself! It lives in the handle. Such engineering! Save your toothpicks for picking teeth or garnishing cocktails.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It does feel a little... light? for lack of a better word. I do honestly hope it lasts for a good long while. I've had too many squeezing-type kitchen tools snap in mid squeeze.<br />- Price vs build. It's priced the same as other presses, though it does seem to be made of lighter material. I guess I will have to wait-and-see. If it lasts more than a couple years, then i think it was worth it.<br />- Cleaning after every clove. Are there presses that effectively alleviate this? I have yet to find one.<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's weird but I really do enjoy using this item. Maybe it's because its the first press I've used that didn't need pre-peeled garlic? Whatever the case, it's helped make our kitchen a little bit happier. Anytime I'm about to add garlic to a dish, I actually announce it so I can draw attention to the fact that I'm about to use the press. I think it's starting to annoy my girlfriend.",5.0
712,"WONDERFUL.  This is the only garlic press I will ever buy or give away again because it is FANTASTIC.  Because I am obsessive - I DO go to the extra trouble of peeling garlic, however, I'm sure you don't need to peel the garlic - this press is that good.  It is very lightweight, easy to press, easy to clean (I wash it by hand,) and, the little swinging plunger inside makes it so you can lift the long handle very high, thus resulting in a lot more pounds of pressure.  It literally presses the bejeezus out of the garlic which comes tumbling out of the holes.  Do not buy a garlic press that doesn't have this extra little swinging plunger on the inside.  It makes ALL the difference.  (Note: The garlic press recommended by America's Test Kitchen is not good at all and does NOT have this extra little swinging plunger.  Hence, my latest acquisition of this wonderful Zyliss press.  ATK rarely makes mistakes, so it is a bit baffling.)  But, I digress.  The nifty little red cleaning tool stores firmly in the press when not in use and easily digs out every single piece of skin with the &#34;teeth&#34; on the end of it.  Very nice touch.  Whoever designed this Zyliss press knew what they were doing.  A ++++",5.0
713,"This is a fabulous tool - how did I cook without it! Had the OXO version and only used it a couple of times - it was awful but I thought that was just the nature of all garlic presses. Then after many years saw a friend using this garlic press and &#34;aha!&#34; - the light bulb came on, it was the brand that was the problem. This Zyliss press works really well, easily presses out the garlic leaving only the skin and cleans up easily. Dump any other brand you have and buy this one, you won't be disappointed.",5.0
714,"I gave up on garlic presses after dealing with so many that just send smashed bits of garlic pieces up behind the plunger. It was easier just to chop the stuff with salt (messier, stickier, and stinkier, but easier). I was quite hesitant to buy this after my past attempts at garlic pressing but the review in Cooks Illustrated convinced me to give it a try. What can I say, I'll never use a knife on garlic again!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />It's big enough to easily squeeze two or three cloves at once.<br /><br />The vast majority of garlic is squeezed through the holes into garlic puree (only a little slips up behind the plunger).<br /><br />The cleaner stores cleverly in the handle (so I haven't managed to lose it yet which is quite a feat).<br /><br />The cleaner stores cleverly in the handle AND its quite a useful little cleaner too!<br /><br />Rinses clean very easily after use and the time I kind of set it to the side and forgot and let the garlic in it dehydrate in to hard little cementy blobs, it came clean just fine in the dishwasher.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I have little hands (I never really knew this until I tried to squish three cloves of garlic). I couldn't get one hand around the handles to do the squeezing.<br /><br />It can be hard to press (of course, as mentioned before, I have little hands - so maybe a big strong manly type man, or a women with a grip could do fine).<br /><br />The handles become slippery if they get at all wet making it even harder to press. As long as I keep it to two cloves (hard to do because it would EASILY hold three or four and I'm lazy and impatient), I don't have any trouble smushing the garlic into submission.",5.0
715,"Who would have thought I'd love a garlic press? But, this one I do. I really do.<br />I had a very old Zyliss, quite a bit smaller than this one, and I long ago lost the nylon (I think) gizmo which pushes the garlic bits out of the holes. But it lasted and lasted and lasted. I expect the same of this one.<br />It holds nearly twice the amount of garlic as the old model, the pusher thingy snaps securely into the handle, and it washes clean really easily. I confess I still smash-and-peel my garlic, mostly because it comes out of our garden and by the end of winter it often needs trimming. When the new harvest comes in, I'll give the no-peel a try.",5.0
716,"This silly little garlic press is the BOMB! I bought one in Florida at the local market while visiting. My host didn't have a garlic press. When I got home I ordered the one I now have from... go figure... Amazon... because they have everything. I've used a bunch of garlic presses and this one is by far the best I've used, and it's not that expensive. The cleaning tool does a great job. Again, the best garlic press ever. I get next to zero garlic escaping up the sides of the press. The tolerances are tighter than your average garlic press.",5.0

Unnecessary to say I have used so many garlic press in the past but this is by far the best garlic press I ever used.No need to peel which does save a lot of time and cleaning it is a breeze.Pros are:<br /> 1.It's made of aluminium unlike my previous press which were made of steel.<br /> 2.I don't know why but I have to apply less pressure in this one compare to my previous garlic press.<br /> 3.It's big enough to fit a bit garlic clove, in my previous press I had to slice it in two part to fit it in.<br /> 4.No residue of garlic except for garlic skin.That means no wastage.<br /> 5.Cleaning is so easy.I can't stress enough built in cleaning tool fits holes perfectly and cleans it completely and as tool is attach to press itself I never loose it.<br /><br />Cons are- Actually I was able to find only one con and that's since it's made of aluminium you might have to face the problem of discoloration.To increase it's life I would highly recommend you guys to hand wash it rather then toss it in dishwasher.<br /><br />I got this for free In exchange of my honest opinion.",5.0
719,"This one works the best out of the few I tried.  Almost zero pulp left behind (I peeled the garlic first) and the masher has little spikes that push everything through the mincing mesh.<br /><br />It is aluminum but seems solid and nicely made.  I would have preferred stainless steel, but the expensive one I tried (the swiss one that gets the highest ratings) did not work as well as this one in my opinion.  This one was easier to squeeze, seemed to have a slightly higher capacity, and leaves almost zero pulp behind.  Was easier to handle overall too. If you need stainless steel the swiss one was good, but this one performs very well and was easy to clean.  I am happy and this is a keeper.",5.0
720,"By Far the BEST Garlic Press on the market!!!<br />  I have been using a Zyliss Susi Garlic Press since the 1980's...  Being of Italian Heritage, I use about 2-3 heads of garlic a week & back in the 80's I broke at least 5 garlic presses until I found the Zyliss at an upscale store.  At that time it was $17.95 ( The price hasn't changed much in 30 years!!!)  WOW, I loved it & STILL have it & it works as good as the day I got it...  I ended up buying 5 of them for gifts back then for the whole family!!!  I have also purchased many kitchen gadgets over the years with the Susi (Zyliss) name & ALL are A#1 Quality!!!<br />  My son just bought me the Zyliss Susi 3 as a Christmas gift & it is GREAT!!!  This one is even BETTER than the original, as it is even easier to squeeze & with this model you can press the cloves thru with peel & all...  The cleaning tool is also Terrific!  My hands aren't as strong as they used to be, so this model is so nice to use, & such a time-saver...<br />  Now I already know what to buy ALL my family members for Christmas next year, but in 2016 I'll have to buy 10...<br />Buy this Garlic Press, & if you enjoy cooking, it will change your Life!!!

721,"I bought a Kuhn Rikon garlic press for $28 on here and it was awful. It was heavy, bulky, and hurt my hand. This a dream machine in comparison! This is light weight and fits in the hand well. I recommend this press to everyone!<br /><br />Yes, the garlic is a bit hard to clean out, but if you wait until it dries, it is easier. HOWEVER, if you buy a Zyliss Garlic press, ALWAYS try to get one with a cleaner.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the Kuhn Rikon, but fortunately, I bought a $16 Zyliss Susi 2 Garlic Press a few days prior to purchasing it at a local kitchen store, so I know the difference between a good garlic press and an overpriced malfunctioning contraption. I was going to return the the Zyliss to a local kitchen store where I bought it, because it didn't have a shiny finish and I thought it was a little hard to clean every tiny piece of garlic out of (later I discovered the cleaner it comes with makes it easy to clean). BUT, I am now keeping the Zyliss and it is a dream compared to the Kuhn Rikon hunk of junk. If you really want a good garlic press, buy the Zyliss, it's far smaller, very light, and I can't possibly see anyone liking the Kuhn Rikon after trying the Zyliss. You've been warned!<br /><br />The Zyliss Susi 2 Garlic Press is not shown on Amazon with a cleaner. So, if you can find one at a local kitchen shop with the cleaner, I would get one.

I haven't used them, but assume they're good. But, I can't recommend any garlic press without a cleaner, just too hard to clean without one. A toothbrush might be an alternative, you could try if you needed to, or waiting until the garlic dries. You have to be able to stick something into the press holes or it just doesn't clean well. With the cleaner, it cleans a a few seconds.<br /><br />I also love the finish on this Zyliss. It is not shiny, so you get no fingerprints. All you have to do is rinse the garlic off, I never have to actually clean it with a sponge or anything, it just doesn't need it. Once you use a garlic press with this sort on finish, you will never want one of the shiny ones again! I'm using way more garlic than I've ever used in my life because of my Zyliss. I'm even using it to press fresh ginger so I can make ginger tea and drinks!",5.0

This has a nice wide handle for a good firm grip when using. The bottom handle also curves upward slightly making it easy to ergonomically easy to grip and press garlic.<br />I am most impressed with the cleaner being stored right in the handle for when it comes time to wash the garlic press.

I did use the brush at the very end of all the mincing to get any of the left over garlic all off.

I didn't have to press very hard for it to work and one of the best parts - I didn't have to peel my garlic before I pressed it.  So now my fingers and hands won't reek of garlic for days. Another great plus is the clean up - this garlic press cleaned up easily in the sink with just normal soap and water. There is an included brush so that you can get at anything that 'stuck,' but I had no issues with that.<br /><br />The Zyliss garlic press is made from cast aluminum  and will last a long time.

The press will break down the cell walls of the garlic clove ensuring that every bit of flavor and juice will be extracted. It is harder to process the garlic cloves with the skin still on, so I always remove the skin. The hopper is large and can probably hold about 4 cloves, but I'm not strong enough to press 4 at a time, so I press them in 2's.

Most of them are terrible and don't even work. I only know two brands that really do the job, and that is Zyliss and Rosle.<br /><br />I prefer the style and size and feel of the Zyliss -- but I do NOT like to use aluminum!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think it's criminal that manufacturers are still making kitchen utensils out of aluminum even though we have known for decades now that aluminum contributes to Alzheimer's disease and more. But don't get me started...  If Zyliss would make this same product out of stainless steel or -- better yet -- a nontoxic ceramic material, I would purchase their product because of its superior design no matter the cost.<br /><br />Rosle makes a stainless steel garlic press that works great, so that's what I am using. It is very bulky and heavy and as if made for a man's large hands and I find it awkward to use, but it works, it's not aluminum and cleans awkwardly-easily. If you don't care if the press is made of aluminum remember that this material also gets blotchy-ugly with age. So pretty brand new, but that won't last.",4.0

This press works beautifully and produces finely minced garlic with very little waste.<br /><br />I saw that some people complained about theirs did not come with a cleaning tool. Well..mine came with one. Maybe back in the day they didn't come with one, but mine did and it works great. Even without the tool, it doesn't take much effort to clean it up.<br /><br />I haven't experienced any of the coating issues some have had, but I've only had this press for a few weeks and have used it probably a dozen times already.

I love using garlic and this makes it super easy. You really don't have to peel the toe if you don't want. Clean up is easy, especially with the plastic peg insert. The Zyliss press does everything it claims.  The only thing to realize is that it does take a certain amount of hand strength to squeeze it closed, more so if you try to do 2 or 3 toes at a time. That may be hard for some.  But if you are looking for a excellent garlic press that doesn't cost a fortune...this is the one to buy.

739,"I bought this garlic press to replace my broken older zyliss model. I was at first disappointed that my older model snapped at the hinges within 3 years of use. I loved the garlic press and wasn't sure if i should buy another once since it broke so fast, but wasn't sure if another garlic press would work as well.<br /><br />So glad I decided to stick with new susi model. It works so much better than the old one. This new model has a great teeth feature on the plunger and it helps grip the garlic and push it through without much effort. It is also much smaller than the old jumbo model i had, I was afraid it wouldn't be able to handle the large garlic pieces. So today i threw in a very big garlic piece with that hard part of the garlic attached to it, i didn't think i'd be able to even close the press cause the garlic was sticking a quarter of the way out. But surprisingly the press went down so easily! I didn't even need to put much strength into it. The older model always required me to ask for assistance or required that i cut off the hard part of the garlic. I'd also always peel off the skins with the older model cause it helped push the garlic through easier, but this new model is easier with the skins.<br /><br />The teeth on the plunger of the new model helps a lot too, it pulls the skin out once the garlic is pressed through. The older model didn't have this feature and i would have to use my fingers to pull the skin out.<br /><br />What i also love about this model is that it doesn't come with the plastic cleaner!! I never used that plastic thing with the old model, it just became a piece of junk in my drawer, what a waste of plastic and space (now my old garlic press is broken and that plastic thing is still sitting in the drawer, i wonder what i could do with it). I agree with another reviewer, i don't understand this problem that many ppl have with cleaning the press. First off, the teeth pulls the skin out for you, it's a great feature. If anything else is stuck in the holes I just use a toothbrush to brush it out. I stab the holes with the brush. If I'm lazy about use the toothbrush, i'll just use my fingers to rub back and forth on the holes, it works way better than that plastic cleaner.<br /><br />Anyways, highly recommend this garlic press! I just hope it doesn't break as fast as the old one. Oh, the hinges on this model look a lot sturdier than the old one, looks metallic whereas the old one was aluminum.",5.0

I think loading up any press would be difficult to use. I have used many presses through the years and have thrown them all out except for this one, which I bought about 5 years ago. I grow my own garlic and when its fresh it's very juicy. Old garlic will become drier and develop a root in the center, which should be removed by cutting it in half; doing it that way you can fill it up and it will have less resistance. However, loading up ANY garlic press with whole and unpeeled (or even peeled) garlic would be difficult for anyone. That said, I truly love using this press, its lightweight and a snap to clean up.

It is big enough to put in key limes, if you have to squeeze a bunch, this is a good way to go. I haven't tried it yet, only saw someone do that on TV.<br /><br />And this doesn't show any signs of breaking, it's very well designed, I don't forsee me breaking off the handle as I have done with other garlic presses in the past.<br /><br />This is one gadget that gets a lot of use in my kitchen and I am very pleased with it's quality.",5.0

Still works well but I'm tempted to buy this Susi for myself.  I'll have to try his next time I'm in California to see if it is ergonomically better for my hands that aren't so strong anymore. 😊,5.0
752,"Once you've owned a susi garlic press, you won't be able to live without it. I don't know what it is with Zyliss, but their design makes this garlic press superior to any other brand's (no, I don't work for Zyliss). It makes the job a cinch and is very effective: no waste whatsoever. There's no need to peel the garlic before sticking it in the press, and cleaning is simply a matter of removing the peel and washing it. I also own a Zyliss susi with the plastic cleaner, and truthfully I don't see a lot of difference.<br /><br />I've given this as a gift to a lot of people, and everyone loves it. For the price, you can't get a better garlic press.",5.0
753,"This is a sturdy garlic press with a chamber large enough for 2 or 3 cloves at a time.  The only issue with this press is that the piston is a bit smaller than the chamber, which allows some of the pressed garlic to leak back past the piston.<br /><br />This is my second Zyliss garlic press.  I lost my other one, the smaller version of this press, in a recent move.  It had the same issue with garlic getting past the piston, and it was so small that even a single clove of garlic would have to be cut to fit.<br /><br />I recommend the larger one with the caveat about the poor piston fit.",4.0
754,Very handy for those who like their fresh garlic.  The cleaner is super helpful to get in all those little holes.,5.0
755,"I've had this jumbo garlic press for about 6 months and I am happy to report that this one ""works""!  I've tried others over the years but they are all too clumsy to use, clog easily, are difficult to use and hurt my hands.<br /><br />This press lives up to its Jumbo name; it holds several cloves and it doesn't get stuck or clog.  I find it so much easier to use and because I don't have to apply as much pressure, it doesn't hurt my arthritic hands.<br /><br />The cool little blue rubber/plastic cleaner is clever design, and it fits nicely in the press for storage so you don't loose it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this item!",5.0
756,"It has a very sturdy build and a good weight to it. I have not forced unpeeled garlic through it, but it pulverizes cloves with ease. I don't know how I lived without a press all these years. The tool they use to help clean it does indeed work.",5.0
757,"I first heard about this garlic press while watching ""Sam the Cooking Guy"".  I will admit I was sceptical and thought that the only way to really mince garlic was by hand.  Plus, the other garlic presses I have owned over the years, were alot more trouble than they were worth(can you say how the heck to you clean this thing?). But, I have become a real fan of this gadget and use it all the time.  Not having to peel the garlic is a real big plus and the power of the press is undeniable.(Not being a big person with big meaty hands). This item should be on all have to have list of gadgets.",5.0
758,"Fits a few garlic cloves, does a great job squishing them and is very easy to clean.",5.0
759,"I love this garlic press. It fits one large clove or 2 smaller ones and does a great job. I don't bother with the flimsy useless plastic cleaner that came with it; I use a vegetable brush instead, poking through the holes.",4.0
760,The best garlic press I've ever owned. The press extrudes almost all the garlic. Very little if any rides up between the walls and the hammer. The cleaning tool makes cleaning it a breeze. I would highly recommend it.,5.0
761,Good Garlic press. This is the only garlic press I have ever owned and it works good for me. The clean out tool is ok but it keeps falling out when I use the press. Not a real problem just put the clean out tool to the side.,5.0
762,"I bought both this one and the Zyliss Susi 2. I like the jumbo much better. It is not that much larger than the susi 2, but it has a flat anvil rather than a spiked one as the Susi 2 does. The Susi does get more garlic out of a clove, but the spikes force the garlic skin into the holes which makes cleaning a real pain. The susi 2 also lacks the rubber cleaner which makes dilodging the skin so easy with the Zyliss Jumbo.",5.0
763,picked one of these up at my local Publix grocery store for $5.99 and it's<br />hands down the best press i've ever used !,5.0
764,New favorite kitchen tool! Recommend to you and all my cooking buddies!,5.0
765,"I've really liked my Zyliss garlic presses.  I gave my last one to my mother-in-law, and (despite my mom's recommendation to get another Zyliss - as my Sicilian grandmother had always used Zyliss) opted for a Kuhn Rikon I found at TJ Maxx.  I was so disappointed.  The mechanical advantage was terrible; it took great effort to press even one chopped-up garlic clove.  Anyway, I went ahead and spent more money on another Zyliss.  The time and effort saved have been well worth the cost.",5.0
766,"After going through many a garlic press (the others kept cracking where the garlic passes through the holes ... I guess I was pushing too hard or something?), I purchased this one based on Amazon reviews. Almost 5 years later it is still going strong. My one complaint is that the silver paint is coming off a bit and I worry that maybe I am eating it. Hopefully it is not too toxic ...",5.0
767,"Folks,<br />It's easy to clean any garlic press by using the plastic dish brush or nail brush that many a kitchen sink has nearby.<br />Just hit the outside surface of the holes with the bristles of the brush to poke any garlic out.<br />Rinse your garlic press after using, so that the garlic doesn't have a chance to dry before cleaning. If dry, just soak it.<br />Soap is not needed, just rinse. Cleaning gizmos are not needed if you have a brush, and toothpicks are silly once you try using a brush.<br /><br />The Oxo press is useless and so are most presses other than Zyliss. Why are they the only ones who understand how to engineer pressing garlic?",5.0
768,Awesome. Best garlic press around. Jumbo size is great. Leaves very little garlic unpressed and virtually none escapes out the sides. This is my second zlyiss and would recommend over all alternatives I have tried.,5.0
769,I've used and searched for many garlic presses and I like this one the best so far. It's pretty easy to use. The cleaner really helps a lot and makes a difference. It can be hard to press if you put 2 or 3 cloves in but not really that hard. One clove at a time and the job is pretty fast! It's fantastic that you don't have to peel the skin you just stick it in and PRESTO - lots of garlic out and toss the skin left in the press. Spend the extra money on Zyliss. Can't beat Swiss made.,5.0
770,"I saw the susi 2 in a store about a month ago.  Always a sucker for Zyliss, I bought one.  My original susi was quite old, and starting to show signs of age.  A few minutes ago, I finally had an occassion to press some garlic, and I am impressed.  It was faster and easier.  Not just easier to press, but easier to get the peels out of too.  I'm about to embark on a personal crusade to preach the joys of this new device to all people I know, regardless of if they cook or not.",99
771,"Alice May Brock is quoted as saying:<br /><br />Tomatoes and oregano makes it Italian;<br /><br />Tarragon and wine makes it French;<br /><br />Sour cream makes it Russian;<br /><br />Lemon and cinnamon make it Greek;<br /><br />Soy sauce makes it Chinese;<br /><br />Garlic makes it good.<br /><br />And Zyliss garlic press makes it oh so easy (and unmessy) to get the garlic where you need it! Don't even have to peel the garlic!<br /><br />(Caution: the cleaning tool (to get any remaining garlic out of the holes) is unidirectional. It does need to be lined up or you will break some of the plastic tines. But you rarely need to use it anyway, it's so simple to clean.)<br /><br />Even America's Test Kitchen loves this garlic press!",5.0
772,Love it!!!,5.0
773,"What a joy to use this garlic press.  It is so easy to use with very little effort.  I am glad I broke my old press which I have had for over  15 years.  I have read many reviews on Zyliss garlic presses and made it my next purchase.  The great feature of this product is that you don't have to peel the garlic, the press does it for you.  I try to cook with the freshest food available and fresh garlic is so much healthier than the powders and salts out there. Enjoy.",5.0
774,Love the fact that I can attach the doohickey that cleans the garlic press holes.,5.0

776,"Recommended by CooksIllustrated, this garlic press is convenience at a reasonable price.  The garlic comes out consistently and without too much effort.  The cleaner is very handy.  Make sure you use it because the coating does tend to scratch.  That being said, handwashing is recommended for longevity. I was so impressed, I bought one as a gift for my sister and another for my mom despite a better, new recommendation from CooksIllustrated.",4.0

779,"The Zyliss Jumbo Garlic Press with Cleaner is the absolute best.  I have used mine for years, and was recently so bummed to find that I have lost the blue cleaner piece (don't know how I lost it - it attaches securely to the press itself).  Anyway, I was so happy to find that the blue replacement cleaner part is available direct from [...] for $1.30 including shipping!!  Thanks, Zyliss!",5.0
780,I had a metal garlic press for many years that has finally bit the dust. This press is the perfect replacement. The large capacity allows more cloves in for crushing and the long handles  make it very easy to use.  Other brands wanted to be cute and had stubby handles which are worthless. The cleaner also fits perfectly into the holes and makes cleanup a snap.,4.0
781,awesome stuff! love it!!,5.0
782,"My Brother-in-law ranted and raved about this Garlic Press so when we had our 3rd cheap garlic press break in two years, we bought a Zyliss and it is the best Garlic Press we've ever used.  My wife and I love to cook so we put our Press through intensive use.  It is so easy to clean and use.  We've recommended them to the rest of our family.",5.0
783,"I had the smaller Zyliss garlic press, but I made the mistake of putting it in the dishwasher, which ruined the finish.  I had to buy another one and this one is better, not just because it is larger, but because the cleaner actually attached under the handle, so it's always right there!  A great idea to improve an already-great product.",5.0
