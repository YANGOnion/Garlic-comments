0,"I had such high hopes for this garlic press. But, I have to join the 1-star group. The main problem is that the press extrudes more garlic around the edges than through the holes. And this is with just one clove in the pocket. (see photos)  Also, I normally scrape off the garlic with a knife. But the press holes area can slip inside the side edge pieces, and when you swipe your knife over it, it isn't flush with the holes so it is difficult to scrape off all the garlic. I have a 30+ year old Susi press that is still working, but I wanted a newer, nicer one that was easier to clean. I'm returning this and going back to my old Susi.<br /><br />The pros:  It is very pretty. It is easy to clean. It is easier to press (takes less force).<br />The cons: Garlic squishes out around the sides, so you get less garlic and you have to clean it out of the nooks. Also - it comes with a large label stuck to one handle and also covering part of the press. It takes quite a lot of work with alcohol or acetone to remove the gummy parts of the label.",1.0
1,"As you know, you'll pay a LOT for this tool, and I used it for the first time last night, and was disappointed. (I didn't have another one to compare this with, so maybe what I experienced was actually superior to others. I just don't know) Although it was suggested that it can be used with the peel on the garlic, this wasn't the case. I tried this, and the &#34;peel&#34; wound up stuck in the piece with all the holes that you can pop open and clean. It was easy to clean, but that part of the device winds up with a square piece of &#34;peel&#34; if you put in garlic with some of the peel on it. I also tried it with ginger. I peeled the ginger first, and placed pieces inside. After a good squeeze, it yielded very little ginger. Ditto with the garlic. You don't get as much out as one would expect, and you have to scrape off the garlic in order to use what winds up on the device after inserting the pieces and squeezing the handles. For those of you out there who have used garlic presses: Is this typical? The the garlic sticks to the blades, and you have to scrape it off?",3.0
2,"I returned this. The garlic just didn't go through the holes as much as it oozed out the sides. I bought this on recommendation from Cook's Illustrated and am usually very happy with their advice, not this time. For the price I thought it would work better, just not worth the price.",1.0
3,"I ordered this garlic press after reading that it was rated the highest with America's Test Kitchen. I use garlic a lot in my cooking, so I wanted to buy the best. I bought it in Oct. '15. I was pleased with it and it seemed sturdier than any other press I've owned in the past. I loved the ease in cleaning. I was using it yesterday (Aug. '16) and I noticed one of the pins holding it together came out, and when I looked on the other side, the other pin was missing. I've always hand washed it, and couldn't believe it fell apart like it did. This was the most expensive press I've ever purchased, and I'm so disappointed that it broke within a few months.",1.0
4,"I really hate to do this.  I have to give a bad review.  I bought into the ATK/Cooks Country or whatever iteration of that show I saw or magazine I read and dropped the coin necessary to obtain a feeling of ultimate supremacy in garlic crushing expediency.  At first I loved it.  The holes were smaller and therefore the garlic was crushed finer.  I like that.  I did not find it easy to use at first.  My wife hated it immediately and stayed with her goto press, the OXO.  I persevered and used the Kuhn exclusively even though I experienced what other one star reviewers had seen.  Capacity not as expected, garlic squeezing out around the press plate, and it was a little difficult to clean, quickly anyway.  Then it broke.  One of the pins that hold the hinge rod flat out broke and the other one just fell out.  All at once.  It is irreparable.  All I can do is toss it.  I just bought it in MAY!!!!<br />Upon reflection it had always seemed clumsy to use and in the end my wife was right AGAIN.  Sigh. Oh well.  We still have the OXO that is far easier to use and clean.",1.0
5,"Disappointed after high expectations. I bought the Kuhn Rikon press to replace my old Zyliss based on the Cook's Illustrated recommendation and the Amazon reviews. I've been using it for about a year and am finally giving up. I plan to buy another Zyliss. With the high price, I was expecting a superior product and am disappointed that I have to ditch it and buy a something else.<br /><br />The problem is that the press doesn't go a great job of forcing the garlic through the holes. The plate with the holes doesn't fit tightly to the sides of the press, so about 1/4 of the garlic gets forced out the sides of the press, resulting in long strips of garlic that I have to mince before using. Further, every time you press a clove, a sheet of garlic fiber is left behind covering the holes. This produces more resistance when you press the next clove, so even more of the next clove is forced out the sides. As a result, in between pressing every clove, we have to scrape the garlic fiber out with our fingers to clear the holes for the next clove. Instead of making pressing garlic easy, this press creates a lot of waste and extra work.<br />Pros: Sturdy, Easy to Clean, Stainless Steel (so no surface peeling).<br />Cons: Waste, Extra work chopping the mess left by the press",2.0
6,"it is from Amazon - so it cant be a knock-off, but really?<br />is this the garlic press everybody was talking about?<br />at least with my old garlic press the cage was one piece, so garlic would squeeze just around the pressure plate.<br />here the garlic is all over the place.<br /><br />nice idea, very poor performance.<br />save the money and go for a 10$ any-brand garlic press, this one does not live up to its name.<br /><br />End of June 2016 Update:<br />After the third time using this product, a piece of metal broke off it.<br />i think i would move forward with returning this item. waste of time, effort and money.",1.0
7,"I was seriously let down by all the reviews that praised this garlic press.  It's true the construction is sturdy and seems durable, but the design is seriously flawed.  Unlike my old garlic press, which had a &#34;basket&#34;-style hopper that had four sides, this Kuhn Rikon Epicurean's hopper has only one side.  This means that when you press a garlic clove, garlic squeezes through the cracks from three sides of the hopper.  Then the squeezed garlic that has missed the holes in the hopper either slips into the dish I'm preparing (as a smashed, flat piece) or is ridiculously difficult to try to push back into the hopper to try again for a proper pressing.  It's difficult to put the squeezed or smashed garlic back into the hopper to try again because when you open the press to get to the garlic that has escaped, there's no catch for the handle and the hopper flips out, dumping whatever garlic is still in the hopper.  What's more, it's a pain in the neck to clean because of the design, so you have to rinse it out as soon as you're done using or you're screwed.  My advice: Look for a garlic press with a large, oval, &#34;basket&#34;-style hopper.  Stainless steel or not, I'd much rather go back to an Oxo.",1.0
8,"Fell apart in my hands after fewer than 10 uses.  Colorful descriptors could be used to tell you how I feel about this product but I'll let you fill that part in.  Item suffers from a fatal flaw: there is a swing arm attached to the compression handle which is fastened by small pins.  It's the upper most pin located on the compression handle - you can see it in the product picture.  On it's final use, may it RIP, after compressing a clove of garlic and opening the press to remove the usual garlic guts, the whole of the compression mechanism collapsed.  Not entirely sure what or why this happened, likely a defective product, which I get, but with the number of other reviews I'm seeing that describe product failure, a customer is taking their chances with this item.",1.0
9,"It's comfortable to use and minces the garlic just fine.  However, the chamber is smaller and the handles are not as ergonomic as my old Oxo garlic press.  I had to trash my Oxo garlic press because the chamber got corroded and looked gross.  I wish the handles of the Kuhn Rikon garlic press were rubberized (like Oxo's) to get a better grip, and that it had a larger chamber so it could fit more garlic.  I do believe the Kuhn Rikon's stainless steel material will resist corrosion better and outlast Oxo's pot metal chamber.  Overall I'm happy with this product and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.",3.0
10,"Add me to the list of complaints regarding the head shearing off of the pin that holds the top and bottom pieces of the press together. This happened the third time I used it, while pressing a single clove of garlic. Unfortunately, as we were out of town when it first arrived, by the time I returned  home and started to use this press, I was already past the time to return. This is either a faulty design, or mine was a faulty product. Either way, I recommend you STEER CLEAR of this KUHN RIKON Garlic Press.",1.0
11,"These was recommended as the Best by Bon Apetit or Cook's Magazine. I find it very heavy, hard to use, difficult to clean, expensive and wasteful because more sticks to it than comes out of it. Hopefully your experience will be different.",1.0
12,"It is an innovative design but has its flaws. The hinged plate makes it easy to clean the holes. But, the hinge design also has gaps on the sides which 'leaks' garlic on the sides and in between the handle joint. These are hard to clean. So, the overall benefit it not that significant.<br /><br />Sturdy product, but handles are not far enough apart; my palm got caught in the squeeze a few times.<br /><br />Returning it.",3.0
13,"I don't get why this is so well reviewed. It is extremely easy to clean, but I'd much rather it was extremely good at mashing garlic. Despite the size of the hamper, if I put it more than one clove, the garlic comes up the sides instead of through the holes. Even if I'm doing one clove at a time, I find that the garlic quickly starts coming up the sides, requiring me to either push it back down or eventually end up with large smashed pieces in my food. This is no worse than my 30 year old garlic press, but now I'm out $40.<br /><br />The best thing about this press is that it is beautiful. However, that's not anywhere good enough for a kitchen gadget.",3.0
14,"This garlic press was great, until less than a month after purchasing it the screws fell out and the entire thing came apart.<br /><br />Update: I contacted Kuhn Rikon and this happened because the vendor, Wonning Store, sells counterfeits. Don't be fooled!",1.0
15,"This garlic press is solidly made with heavy, good quality stainless steel. There are two reasons I dinged it a couple of stars.<br />1. It's pretty easy to press unpeeled cloves and the reason for that is about 1/2 of the clove doesn't even go through the extrusion holes but oozes up around the plunger. Garlic isn't very expensive but I'd like my press to work properly.<br /><br />2. The handles have to be fully closed for it to do its job and more than once I've pinched the flesh at the base of my thumb. Ouch!",3.0
16,"Garbage.  It worked OK for about a month, then fell apart.  I hand wash it carefully between uses.  Poor quality control in manufacturing.  There are splined ends that fit into the pivoting parts, one of them fell out and now the press is useless.  I have had Zyliss presses that last decades, Oxo presses that lasted about 15 years, this fell apart in a month.  A design issue which might be a problem for some is that, even when functioning, the press allows some squeeze-by as the garlic passes through the space where the plate meets the sidewalls, but the poor construction made that a moot point.",1.0
17,"Clunky, expensive.  Cleaning is not much better than that using other types of press, and it doesn't seem to press out more garlic. I like handles the least. It's someone difficult to press the garlic. It just doesn't feel natural in my hands.  I used a $10 garlic press in the past; it didn't look quite as nice, but it seemed to work better.  Also when it comes to cleaning. With other devices you might have more problem cleaning out the vessel where you put the garlic, but in this device there are grooves in the handles, and cleaning that is as time consuming.",1.0
18,"I bought this based on reviews here and America's Test Kitchen. It's a solidly made product. After having used it for a while, I can honestly say it really isn't worth paying such a high price. Previously, I used an Oxxo Grips and that did the SAME job. Both press out garlic. Both have garlic coming up over sides. Both require pressure to exert garlic. The hopper is a pain because it pops up while you're placing garlic sending clove flying.  I prefer the Oxxo because there isn't a hopper and it comes with the self cleaning prongs. I don't see any difference in the quality of the pressed cloves. I am keeping it because I needed another for my second home, but if I hadn't waited to return I would've bought another Oxxo.",3.0
19,"This is so close to being a perfect garlic press, it's maddening that they didn't get it right.  It feels like a prototype that no one actually tried to use.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it's very easy to press, much more so than any other I've used.  This is probably the main selling point, and it's because the hammer part has a lever mechanism connecting it to the upper handle so you get much more power.  The trouble is, because the hammer is disconnected from the handle and swings up faster than it, it's very hard to clean any garlic bits that get up above it.<br /><br />The basket is also too small.  It's only a couple of millimeters less in length and width than the Kuhn Rikon Easy-Clean Garlic Press, but that makes a big difference and makes it feel a lot more cramped.  It's also not machined as precisely so more garlic squeezes out around the edges.<br /><br />I really wish they would just make a straight metal version of the Easy-Clean.  That one is harder to press but does a better job; but being plastic, it's not built for the stress and mine broke after about two years.  This one will no doubt last much longer but it doesn't quite perform as well.",3.0
20,"I bought this after seeing it highly recommended on America's Test Kitchen. Unfortunately, I'm not in love with it. Had a calphalon before this and I don't really see this as an upgrade save for the fact that it's a little bit easier to clean. I was hoping it would be super easy on the hands; I was disappointed. And if you leave the skin on your garlic (which they claim you can do) it's 1000x harder to press. Still searching....",3.0
21,"We use a garlic press as much as any other tool in our kitchen.  When our old one (Pampered Chef) needed to be replaced, we read Amazon reviews on the various presses.  We decided to splurge on this one because we wanted something out of stainless steel, and wanted something that would last for many years.  So we chose this one by Kuhn Rikon.  So far, we are really disappointed.  It is hard to use--when you hold it open with one hand to put in the garlic, you have to hold onto a special lever with your thumb. Then when it presses out the garlic, lots of the garlic gets stuck in a little no-man's-land area at the base of the grille.  So: hard to use, wastes garlic. But it is stainless steel.  I have decided to keep using for 1-2 more weeks, then see how I feel.  Will update then.<br /><br />Updated May 2017<br />Well, it's been a lot more than 1-2 weeks but here's an update.  I still hate this garlic press, but we still use it.  I find it cumbersome to use, and it still wastes garlic, and spits out chunks of garlic on the sides.  However, it is well made, really easy to clean, and it is stainless steel so it is durable.  I have just been too busy with other stuff to make replacing it a priority.  My husband likes it, though.",3.0
22,"Sent this back. I was anticipating more given the fact that this press won the top choice from America's Test Kitchen recently. I tried several times to get this to work properly, but it wasted lots of garlic, was messy, clunky, and difficult to clean. I will not trust another review by America's Test Kitchen, as I can only surmise that they are possibly bought out and give good marks in exchange for other considerations. Just guessing, but this press is far from a top choice in my opinion. I'm going back to the Zyliss classic. Though not perfect, it wastes little.",2.0
23,"Heavy, clumsy design (watch your hand when squeezing, that it doesn't get pinched in the sharp edges of the handle). a lot of clove (and juice) is left in the hopper after pressing, meaning you need to prep and use more cloves or smoosh together the remainder into the hopper for one last press. I read that this one produced &#34;more even-sized pieces&#34; but I did not find this to be the case (rather chunky, in fact)<br /><br />I prefer my Zyliss to this one. and wish I had purchased another Zyliss instead of this one (which was more expensive).",2.0
24,"Within a month of light use, the rivet on the hinge for holding the garlic cloves fell out and the press is now basically worthless.  The basic design of this press seems good -- easy to clean, for example.  But I'm obviously not impressed that a $30 garlic press would break within a couple months of purchase.",1.0
25,Clunky. Pinches fingers. Hopper too small.,1.0
26,"I've owned this for a year and it broke today. A pin fell out of the side and I'm not sure it can be fixed.  Bit pricey, and I thought sturdy, to have to replace it already. Americas Test Kitchen recommends it. I'll write them next. So bummed!",1.0
27,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I don't really love this thing.  I bought it to replace another high-end garlic press that I felt left too much garlic behind.  I bought this on Cook's Illustrated recommendation.  First, this thing leaves just as much garlic behind in the press, so no improvement there.  Second, it's brick heavy and much more fiddly to load.  Third, to clean it you have to dig out the remaining garlic by hand or with a knife point, scrub at it, and waste a lot of water.  My other model has a little plastic &#34;brush&#34; that fits thru all the holes and just ejects the remaining garlic.  My search for the perfect garlic press continues...",3.0
28,"We have used the Pampered Chef garlic press for years. However, it recently bit the dust so we decided to try this one based on reviews of others. This press doesn't handle the larger cloves like I would like and even with peeling them, there is still quite a bit of film left in the press afterwards. The PC press was much more efficient and it came with a cleaning tool for easily removing the leftover film.<br /><br />This is okay, but only when on sale as the regular price would definitely not be worth it. It does seem to be well-constructed and is definitely attractive. All-in-all though I would recommend you go with the Pampered Chef press if you can.",3.0
29,"Item was broken on arrival. I searched high and low for a garlic press that was heavy duty and easy to clean. After watching several reviews, I settled on this one.

I returned it and I'm not feeling very confident about ordering a new one. Plus they have doubled the price since then.",1.0
30,"I compared this garlic press to the vacu vin press. I'm returning this as I liked the vacu vin better. Why? Vacu vin has a bigger area to put more cloves, built in garlic scraper and utilized more of the clove- less waste. I also liked the shape of the cut garlic better. I found that the Kuhn squished garlic out the edges into the handle area, pinched my hand and wasted more garlic. It was smooth and easier to squeeze. My husband and I tried both and preferred the vacu vin.",3.0
31,"I purchased this in May 2016 following the recommendation of a popular cooking magazine. I have used garlic presses for decades and have loved some and hated others. This, sadly, falls into the latter category. I tried to like it, but it's bulky and unwieldy and if you try to press more than one clove at a time or even consecutively, some of it just smooshes out the sides, unminced. Sure, it's a bit easier to clean (they're all a pain, tbh) but access to the different parts also makes it more unwieldy to operate. Finally, today it just fell apart. The pin came out and the pieces flew everywhere ejecting garlic as it went. I have never, never had this happen. And, so expensive! What a waste.",1.0
32,"After seeing all the glowing reviews, I was really psyched to get this garlic press. Having used it for several months now, I must say I have rarely been so disappointed with a kitchen product. I am annoyed literally every time I use it, which, given my love of garlic, is quite often.<br /><br />The press has a fairly unique design, where the curved top handle extends the whole length of the press and fits over the sides of the bottom handle when pressed. Although it may look cool, in practice, it means that unless you're careful, it's quite easy to pinch the heel of you palm between the segments. Bad design! To clean the press, you swing it all the way open (past 180º), exposing the crushing plate and the holes. True to other reviews it really is fairly easy to clean. However, you can't press garlic from this position. To do that, you have to swing it to less than a 180º opening angle. However, the press won't stay in this configuration, meaning you must hold it down with your thumb to keep it from swinging open and dumping your uncrushed garlic out into your food. Once the garlic is loaded, you then have to move your thumb out of the way--an annoying extra step that slows down the whole process. Again, poor design. Once your thumb is out of the way, you can deliver the coup de grace and crush that garlic (being careful not to also crush your hand)! Great. Except that only a smallish fraction of the garlic actually gets crushed through the little holes. Something like half of the volume of the clove ends up smashed flat against the bottom of the crushing surface and doesn't come out--even if you peel the garlic first. You have to pry this flattened bit out between before you can crush any more cloves. Again, bad design. If you try to put multiple cloves in, a significant amount of partially-crushed garlic comes up the sides, where it is likely to fall into your food. If I wanted large partially-crushed chunks, I would have just used a knife. The garlic that does make it through the press seems to be nicely minced, but it tends to stick to the bottom of the press rather than falling (or squirting) into your food, neccesitating another step to scrape the garlic off. All in all, this press does only a mediocre job at crushing garlic. Plus it's annoying to use. I recommend going with another, simpler product.",1.0
33,"Honestly, I'm so surprised at how lousy this thing is.  It was rated in the America's Test Kitchen as their pick.  I had a Pampered Chef press that was 20 times better than this.  This didn't press garlic. It smooshed it out the sides and then it gets stuck closed because of all the garlic that is stuck...

Although the garlic press has a heavy and solid construction, the press is not simple or easy to clean, and (frankly) produces pressed garlic that is inferior to our older, less expensive garlic press.

Other garlic presses I've owned either lose their finish and start flaking/turning my hands black (Zyliss), or the rubber handles start sliding off (Oxo)<br /><br />Cons: the hopper doesn't hold all that much garlic. The garlic oozes out the sides and through the front into the crevice which I can't get to easily without using a toothbrush. The percent of garlic extruded through the press the way it's supposed to is pretty small, I have to spend a lot of time scraping garlic off of all the other surfaces just so they can be pressed properly through the metal pores, by then so much garlic has stuck to my hands instead of going into the pan.

However, too much is left in the holder or on its sides or on the top or anywhere except in the bowl.  It does clean easily.  All-n-all, use a knife.  Better consistency and you get all of the clove.",3.0
51,"It doesn't crush garlic the way you'd think it should. It just sort of mashes it, and nothing comes through. Or, the garlic goes around the edges of the press, so you have to go grab it from there. It's easier to just cut the garlic, honestly. Not a great product, despite what America's Test Kitchen says.",2.0
52,"Because the model recommended by America's Test Kitchen got so-so reviews on Amazon, I went with this one, which one of those reviewers recommended. (That reviewer said the ATK recommended press broke.) Well, okay. It hasn't broken; indeed it's sturdy enough to easily press through 2 cloves at a time! However, I find it awkward to use, as the extruding ""plate"" is hinged and flops around. And cleaning is no easier than other presses of similar design. I don't think it's worth the price. My next press will be of the kind that has a completely separate extruding plate that is more easy to clean.",3.0
53,"I was very disappointed with this garlic press. When it arrived I had a terrible time removing the adhesive of the sticker that's placed on the actual press, which made cleaning off the also-sticky garlic more difficult after use. What's more disappointing is that this garlic press did not even last for one season -- I bought it in June and the pin that kept the two handle pieces together fell out in September and I have not been able to get it to stay in since. This was beyond the one-month return policy so I was not able the return the press or exchange it. For what I paid, I was not expecting to only get three months use out of this product, and I will be looking into buying single-piece garlic presses in the future.",1.0
54,"I've probably spent more on garlic presses than anyone else writing reviews here. About 2 years ago I bought every press I could get my hands on, from grocery stores to gourmet specialty shops to Amazon, on a quest for the best. MOST OF THEM ARE JUNK!! Eventually, I concluded that this one was the best ever(it was also one of the most expensive) -- so I gave it to my daughter! Now, tired of making do with inferior equipment, I finally bought one for myself.<br /><br />I should have bought one back then, because *this is not a very good press anymore*. The price is lower, but so is the quality.<br /><br />The first tip-off was the need for a razor blade and alcohol just to get the brand and ""made in china"" stickers off the handle. Then I noticed that the handles clacked against each other when it was all the way closed, where my recollection was that there was a bit of springy tension between the basket and press plate that held the handles apart in the other. The whole thing rattled when shaken. But the worst was when I put a clove in. The mince came out a watery pulp, and it left about 20% of the clove in the basket. Not the same device at all. The one I gave to my daughter pressed a clean, dry, uniform mince, and left only a paper-thin wisp of residue. It really was a beautiful thing.<br /><br />I learned much from my little research project a while back. First and foremost: close tolerances! If there is much gap between the plunger and the basket, the garlic will squeeze up around the plunger instead of down through the mincing holes. Secondly, the mechanism should allow the user to apply some pressure between the plunger and the basket at the fully-closed position, to squeeze the last little bit through.  This press is uniquely designed, but those are the two operative principles where this device fails. A millimeter here, a millimeter there, and you go from best in the world to just another piece of junk that looks like it should work but doesn't.<br /><br />I read a one-star review, and I think it was obviously written by a Zyliss marketer, but I'll still agree with him/her that the best you can do, for now,  is the Susi 2. It has deficiencies, some of which are design flaws in my opinion, but it gives the best results currently(January 2011).<br /><br />Here's hoping Kuhn Rikon comes to their senses and tightens up their tolerances, or that someone else will manufacture a really good press like this one used to be. I have no problem with more traditional designs(hinged plunger, integral cleaning head), if only someone will make one really well, as Kuhn Rikon used to do with this design.<br /><br />In summation: used to be great, now barely mediocre, shake your head in disappointment and go with the Susi 2.",3.0
55,"...I think I paid around $35 for this press.  It replaced a decent, and cheap, OXO, that we used literally until the metal bent out of shape and broke.  This thing is really big, I have medium sized hands for a woman, and I have a hard time getting the two handles together to press.  However, the actual press plate is fairly small, and I can really only fit one large, or two smallish cloves in it. The first time I used it, I pinched the palm of my hand pretty good (which seems like a totally dumb move, but is actually easy to do with the way the top handle squeezes over the bottom one).  So now, I have to catch myself before I do it again and again.<br /><br />Also, for $35, I expected a garlic press that pressed the entire clove out, leaving none or just a few specs of garlic leftover in the press.  NOPE.  This thing squeezes garlic out more around the outside of the plate than through the holes in the plate.  WTF.  There is always a big clump leftover, enough that I usually take it out, put it on a cutting board and mince it.  Isn't the press supposed to eliminate that?<br /><br />The ONLY thing that I like about this thing is that it is extremely easy to clean.  Everything comes apart enough that I can get into every little nook and cranny.  Also, since it's all stainless, it never keeps that garlic smell, therefore smelling up my drawer.",2.0
56,"I purchased this based on all the five star reviews that are posted. Well, I am sadly disappointed. The handles are the best thing about this press, not the pressing ability. I pressed very hard and the garlic left in the cup was much more than expected. I loved my simple garlic press purchased from Italy but I lost it in a move!!! I guess I should have gone to a brick and mortar store to see this press and I would not have been so quick to purchase it.",3.0
57,"I purchased this garlic press on the recommendation of Cooks Illustrated since my previous favorite press finally came apart after many years of service and apparently has been discontinued.  The Kuhn Rikon press does work, but it is very heavy and big, and my wife can barely squeeze the press because of its size and weight.  Also, I do not find the press that easy to clean, even though the basket swings out.  The previous press was very easy to clean as one just swung the handle 180 degrees and there were prongs that pushed the squeezed garlic out of the holes back into the tray.  With the KH, one has to take a small sharp object and fish out the residual garlic.",3.0
58,"I am so disappointed in this press.  I was really excited to use it based on all the positive reviews.  It is sturdy, but can be difficult to squeeze and the garlic easily gums up and has to be cleaned out after each press (I do peel the cloves before using the press).  My previous press fell apart, so I suppose this is better, but not what I was expecting for the price.",3.0
59,I was really excited to finally get this garlic press as it was &#34;Highly Recommended&#34; and rated as the best garlic press by America's Test Kitchen.  What a complete disappointment!  It was not cheap and in my opinion...a complete waste of money! It appears that the part that presses the garlic is way too small for the part where the garlic is placed. More garlic pushes up and back around the part that presses...than actually goes through the holes underneath. I have to gather it all up and press it through several more times. That never happened with my trusty old Susi. The only good thing about it is that it is easy to clean.,1.0
60,"I've had this press for 3 years now and I find I use it less and less.  Yes, it is a very well constructed piece of equipment and I'm always willing to pay a premium for quality.  However, this press has a design flaw in that much of the garlic squirts out the sides rather than through the grating.  Compared to my old SUSI press, this press just seems to waste alot of the garlic.  Also, the ease of cleaning is a bit overstated in many of these reviews.  The grating swings out for cleaning, but it is still a rather slow and finger-intensive process to remove the spent cloves (and wasted  minced garlic that is always in there).  So it's built like a tank, looks great, but only works so-so.  I'm going to try some other presses.",3.0
61,"The good: it smashes garlic nicely, and it doesn't corrode easily.<br />The bad: hard to clean. It leaves the &#34;skin&#34; of the garlic every time, embedded firmly in the 'grater box', and you have to fish it out at great effort.<br /><br />I'm going back to using my knife, smashing it on a cutting board with the side of the blade and then dicing it. It gives you a better product, but it breaks knives.",3.0

66,"I had high hopes for this garlic press. Since it was chosen by Cook's Illustrated as the best garlic press, I was willing to pay the high price for it.  A good garlic press should finely mince the garlic leaving behind the fibrous parts. This press doesn't do that at all. Most of the garlic comes out in large stringy fibrous strands on either side of the perforated plate. I think that is why it is so easy to squeeze. I suppose if you want it merely to smash garlic it would work but that can be accomplished with the side of chef's knife blade.<br /> If you want a press that produces finely minced garlic, like for salad dressing, you should NOT buy this one.

And I agree with other reviewers that feel the capacity is way to low. My old press was double the capacity and had a plastic part attached to the handle that when swung around punched all the holes clean at once.

I am an avid home cook, and have been happy with my sussi zyliss garlic press for years.  The Kuhn Rikon is beautifully made, it has great leverage.  The area that holds the garlic is too small to handle certain cloves of garlic.  There are seams on it where the garlic can escape from when being crushed.  The worst design flaw is that it almost always pinches my hand while crushing.  That being said, the clean up is easy, and it's a kitchen gadget that is built to last.  I do think it is way overpriced, and would say if you already own a zyliss, stick with it.",3.0
86,I used this product only twice before it broke.  The pin that is on the upper handle that acts as a pivot for the garlic crusher pad broke.  It appears that the pin is not one solid piece all the way through.

I feel it doesn't utilize all the garlic clove that efficiently either. It says it works better with the skins left on, but I would disagree with that. after about 4 or 5 cloves you have to open it up and clean it out. And it can be kind of messy and some of the good pressed garlic falls out the side. So no, I would not buy it again if I had it to do all over again. The oxo one was just fine.",3.0

And it's easier if you don't use the large cloves.  And it's also easier if you remove the remnants of the preceding clove from the press before attempting to press another one.

All you have to do is rinse the garlic off, I never have to actually clean it with a sponge or anything, it just doesn't need it.

It had a lot of great reviews on Amazon, so we were really excited about this, particularly as a replacement for a far flimsier plastic garlic press that we had previously.

This means that about 1/3 or more of the mashed garlic does not pass through the grate, but instead leaks out and above the presser pad.  This makes a mess and means that a significant portion of the garlic is not fully mashed.<br /><br />As others have speculated recently, Kuhn Rikon appears to have changed or moved their manufacturing processes for this press over the last few years.  Thus, the positive reviews from 2007 were no doubt accurate, but may not reflect the current design of the device.  The current design is unfortunate and disappointing.",2.0

192,"I have had this press for 9 months and have used it frequently enough (1x to 3x weekly) to justify my rating. I bought this based on the Cook's Illustrated recommendation.<br /><br />This press definitely is a beautiful, high quality tool - very heavy, solidly built, satiny stainless steel.  It is a bit large for my hands and somewhat difficult to squeeze.  I would not call it ergonomic for small hands.  It does make nicely minced garlic, but I also have had problems with garlic being squeezed out along the sides of the press, as mentioned by other reviewers.  Also, there is a flat piece of garlic left in the press that I need to fold over in order to get the whole clove pressed (this also happens with my Zyliss and is one reason I was searching for a new press).  It does not work very well on smaller, flat cloves of garlic, even if multiple cloves are put into the press.<br /><br />The part with holes is a separate piece that flips out and it tends to annoyingly flip up if you do not make a conscious effort to hold it down (but there is a convenient finger tab, so it was well designed).  Although it is easy to clean due to the hinged parts, it is still more difficult to clean than my classic Zyliss press due to the flip up part with holes (not just due to the holes themselves, but also due to the junction areas of the parts).  The handles are smooth and rounded, though, so no gunk gets stuck inside them.  Overall, it is just kind of clumsy to handle.<br /><br />When I first got the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean press, I probably would have given it 5 stars since I was enamored with its beauty (even the name sounds regal).  But after using it for 9 months, sorry to buck the 5-star trend, but I am giving the KR press 3 stars.  It is very expensive and I find myself going back to my trusty Zyliss Susi Deluxe garlic press since it is faster to use - just open, throw in the clove and squeeze - and just as effective.  I even dug the Zyliss out of the Goodwill donation bag so that I could continue using it.  I wash the Zyliss out with my sink sprayer and garlic comes out of the holes easily (even easier if I wet it down and let the garlic remnants sit for a few minutes - they tend to plump up and out of the holes - this is also true for the KR press) (I threw out the Zyliss plastic cleaning tool since it was unnecessary) (yes, I also know the trick about not peeling the cloves, but I don't like to waste any of the garlic that would be left inside the peel).  The Zyliss was Cook's Illustrated's previous favorite garlic press.  I have not had much problem with the Zyliss coating flaking off, as noted by CI.  I know the Zyliss was re-designed in the last year or two, so I'm not sure how the current design compares to the one I have.  A stainless steel Zyliss would be great to have...<br /><br />Anyway, bottom line on the KR - high quality, expensive, does the job, not much easier to clean than other presses.",99

I did try this once with unpeeled garlic just to see if it would work (with and without root-end removed) - no joy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Solidly built.<br />* The tiny holes make a very fine pressed garlic.<br />* The easy-clean feature doesnt make it &#34;easy&#34;, but does make it &#34;less hard&#34; to clean that some other presses.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Big and heavy - takes up more space in the drawer than other presses.<br />* Lots of waste - garlic squishes up the sides and out the back of the presser area. If crushing multiple garlic cloves, the super-thin paper on the cloves (not the hard peel which I remove) clogs the tiny holes in this press. Subsequent cloves have even more loss/waste unless you stop and clean the press.<br />* It can be hard to load - the &#34;easy-clean&#34; grid-plate flops around, so it isnt just a case of &#34;toss in a couple cloves and press.&#34; Time saved cleaning is lost in trying to simply use this tool.<br />* It really isnt easy to clean. You flop it this way, you flop it that way, you pick little bits of garlic out of here and there... even afterwards I usually find bits of dried garlic in the press that I missed. I've had presses in the past that were easier to clean.<br /><br />People who love this press must really *want* to love it.  I suppose after spending $45 on a garlic press you need to convince yourself that you made the right choice.  Or, perhaps people hang these in their kitchens as decoration?  It's not a *bad* press; it's just not a very good one.  It is well built.  If it were $15 it would simply be mildly disappointing. For $45 you can buy three other garlic presses and see which one you like best.  I'm trying the OXO press next. Wish me luck ;-)",2.0
194,"I ordered this because Cook's Illustrated rated it Best Garlic Press.  I use to sell Pampered Chef and thought they had a great garlic press, but thought I deserved the best  - so gave it to my daughter and bought this one for myself.  It is very heavy and has a wide spread. It has a middle part that swings freely between the handles to make it easier to retrieve the garlic skins and leftovers.  Good concept but I found the use of it awkward .I trusted Cook's Illustrated and thought I'd get more use to it. I really wanted to like it.  Within the 1st few months, it broke.  The pin came out that kept the handles and press attached.  I called the company.  They were very nice but reported they'd discovered Amazon has suppliers selling fake Kuhn Rikon and seriously doubted if it was genuine.  Still, they would honor the guarantee.  She promptly sent me a new one.  (Looked & felt identical to the first one to me. )  The new one did seem easier to squeeze but I continued to find it awkward to use.  It was so heavy and that middle piece that had the skin on it made a mess as I chased it trying to get it to release the paper skin.  I also just couldn't squeeze it tight enough to feel I was getting much garlic through the press.  I also found it more difficult to clean.  I begrudgingly realized I missed my old Pampered Chef press.  When out shopping one day I saw a Zyliss Garlic Press  (who use to make my Pampered Chef one).  I just broke down and bought it.  It was much cheaper and I'm much happier.  The Zyliss is light, and can press the same unpeeled garlic clove more easily for a higher yield.  If I use a knife to cleanly slice the grated garlic free of the press, the skin generally lifts right out cleanly.  If it doesn't, the self-contained cleaning tool always does the trick.  The Zyliss I bought is the same as the amazon Zyliss 2 listing.<br />In summary, this one does the job & could probably handle 2 larger cloves where my new Zyliss will only handle 1;  BUT, I found it faster to use the Zyliss twice vs using this one once.  I would not buy it again and much prefer the Zyliss.  The Zyliss is also dishwasher safe, whereas I hesitated to put this one in.  The pretty stainless water -spotted and the service gal on the phone said it was better to handwash it.",2.0
195,"Oh man. Is this a knock off? The bolts/screws on the side of this were misaligned and make it so the thing completely jams...making it so I can barely get garlic in, let alone clean it. Super bummer. I love garlic and was pretty stoked to be &#34;treating myself&#34; with this pricier press that seemed so awesome. You guys...the Kuhn Rikon website sells this item for $45! Why is it so cheap on Amazon? Buyer beware. I'm also disappointed that I have to go through the hassle of returning it. I took pics of the problem. You'd think that'd be enough. :(",1.0
196,"Amazon should provide a way for customers to get in touch with the manufacturer before they write a scathing review. Why? Because it will allow the manufacturer a chance to remedy the situation before their product gets vilified.<br />So, since you give me no choice, here goes...<br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.<br />I bought this garlic press 32 days ago (and yes, I cannot return it because I've gone over the 30 day time limit). Anyway, I used it 3 times. It worked great. The other day I tried to use it but it seemed lose and would not crush the garlic. On closer inspection I saw that one of the screws/bolts near the hinge had come lose and would not go back into it's slot. The garlic press is now useless. Please keep in mind I did not drop, force, or mistreat this garlic press in any way.<br />Will the manufacturer refund me or send me a new press? We'll see. If they do I will post a review that they have tried to remedy a bad experience. If not, then that's a shame.",1.0
197,"I was looking for something to replace the junk presses I kept getting at the local stores... Watched a bunch of reviews, came down with this one. Overall, I think it is better than the ones I god before, not sure if it is worth the money but I am keeping it. One of the reasons I dis not give it a 4 star rating is the placement of the heavy duty &#34;protection tape&#34; on the part shown in the photo. It took me  some real effort and time to get it off and the glue residue is still there... I don't get it.",3.0
198,"For an expensive garlic press, I expected some fancy packaging, but this came in a plastic bag!! It is supposed to have lifetime warranty, but no cards or inserts of any sort. It almost seems like Amazon shipped a refurbished item or something! It did have a sticker on it with brand name and ""Made in China"" with barcode.",3.0
199,"Honestly I can't see how this is any better than any other garlic press I've used over the years.  For the price and from reading the reviews I had higher hopes that this might actually do a great job but we are disappointed.  Fact is this thing is just another garlic press that has all the same shortcomings of every other press out there.  The garlic squishes out every which way and it is somewhat difficult to clean the skins from the sieve area.  Even peeled garlic leaves skins that have to be peeled from the sieve using the point of a knife.  Truthfully, garlic presses are one of those kitchen tools that could seriously benefit from a talented machinist doing a redesign and re-think of the entire process.  Someone needs to design a press with much tighter clearances and more precision so the crusher surface fits into the garlic hopper area so garlic doesn't squish out all around the crusher area.",2.0
200,"It's hard to believe that almost 1200 people are wrong, but this product simply doesn't work well. While I can tolerate the garlic that rides up the sides of the press, the amount left in the bottom is almost a third of what I put in.<br /><br />The problem is that the engineers have focused too much a product that is easy to clean (which it definitely is), at the sacrifice of a design that allows the user to exert enough weight on the garlic to mince all of it. I don't profess to be an expert in garlic crushers, but I have used over a dozen in my lifetime and this one sits at the bottom in terms of efficiency. Sad but true. 2 stars for looking good and being easy to clean.<br /><br />UPDATE: Downgrading to 1 star:<br />I went ahead and bought the Garject&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamfarm-Garject-Charcoal-Black-Garlic-Press/dp/B00XCT0R72"">Dreamfarm Garject Charcoal Black Garlic Press</a>&nbsp;on someone elses recommendation. I must say, the Garject is by far the superior product and much easier to clean than this one. I don't know if I like the Garject so much because it such as massive upgrade from this ineffectual product, or it is really that good. Anyway, to spend your money on a product that actually works. So long story short, if anyone wants a free Kuhn Rikon garlic press and lives in the Boston area, feel free have my one. It's currently sitting in a cupboard in my hallway gathering dust.",1.0
201,"I ordered this one but cancelled before it shipped. Although it is well reviewed by a lot of people, the negative reviews were significant. I discovered that even many of the four star reviewers found defects that I would not want in a garlic press. These included being hard to clean, garlic spraying around, garlic squeezing out the sides, the potential to get pinched by the handles, and a small capacity garlic hopper. Actually, a number of people who gave the Rikon 5 stars still complained that the hopper was too small and they had to cut large cloves to fit!! It was as if the reviewers were under mass hypnosis to like this press, but then wrote critical reviews while giving the press 4 or 5 stars anyway. How crazy is that?<br />So I thought, Why risk it? I cancelled my order and subsequently  came across a fascinating YouTube review for the Garject. It was designed by a design firm in Australia called Dreamfarm. They specialize in kitchen gadgets and this product won 3 design awards. It's both beautiful and innovative and works extremely well.<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjxOfZfHQj8<br /><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamfarm-Garject-Garlic-Presses-Red/dp/B007ADJ4JI"">Dreamfarm Garject Garlic Presses, Red</a><br />  I bought it and it may be the most perfect garlic press ever. It's very heavy duty, easy to squeeze. gets almost all the clove to come through, holds several standard size cloves or one very jumbo clove and has built-in gadgets to remove the garlic skins and clean the holes. It even scrapes off the squeezed out garlic from the holes. Your fingers never need to touch the garlic. And it's cheaper (slightly) than the Kuhn press. For those still seeking something better, this is it!",2.0
202,"Would you pay $100 for a super-functional daily tool? Cooks illustrated gave this a Highly Recommended review.<br /><br />What about the escape of garlic chunkiness  from the sides due to a too-narrow press in a too-wide well?'  In this day and age, is it impossible to reduce the gap to 0.2 mm?  No.  Close enough fit to prevent airlock, while preventing semisolid material from escaping.<br /><br />Change the compression/cutting  plate with holes to a grid with knife-sharp gridded blades, actually sell sets with ..5, 1.0, 1.5 mm cutting grids.  Make the blades ceramic for longevity. Obviously, make these cutting plates removable.<br /><br />For present designs and difficulty cleaning cracks and holes, try a Waterpik. Of course it works.",3.0
203,"I used this for about 4 years after receiving as a gift. Somewhat complicated and awkward, smallish hopper, too much garlic gets pushed upwards instead of thru the press and kind of a pain to clean. Prior to that I had a Trudeau which was a big disappointment. I also had a Zyliss that I liked but broke after about 15 years.<br /><br />I recently bought the Zyliss Susi 3 - it's much improved over my prior Zyliss and really wonderful. Minces nicely, large hopper and cleans very easily (I don't even bother with the included cleaning tool). Can't imagine why anyone would prefer the Kuhn to the Zyliss. ATK is generally reliable but think they screwed up on garlic presses - they also thought favorably of the sucky Trudeau.",3.0
204,Americas Test Kitchen made a big deal about this thing and yes it is better than my Garlic Press from Ikea but it's not as if it's the ultimate press. It's heavy and cumbersome and still leave a bunch of uncrushed and crushed garlic everywhere that you have to scrape off with a knife and get all over your fingers. So how was this any better?,3.0
205,"This garlic press is reasonably easy to use, although as with most such presses people with small hands, such as my wife, will have a hard time squeezing the garlic through the holes.<br /><br />Aside from that, I liked the Kuhn Rikon Garlic Press at first, but I soon discovered its major flaw: there are small gaps between the screen through which the garlic is pressed (i.e., the part with the holes) and the frame around it. That's because the screen flips up and out of the frame for easy cleaning, a plus that attracted me to this press. However, those gaps allow pieces of garlic peel to be pushed through the press and into your food. Although those small pieces of peel may dissolve during cooking, I prefer that there be no peel in my food, especially in raw dishes such as salad dressings. And even if you peel the garlic before pressing it, large flat uneven pieces of garlic pass through the gaps.<br /><br />Two of the main benefits of a good garlic press are 1) you don't have peel the garlic and 2) the pressed garlic is of uniform size. The Kuhn Rikon fails on both counts, IMHO, and I've therefore gone back to my trusty old Zyliss Susi DeLuxe Garlic Press (which Amazon carries). Granted, the Kuhn Rikon is easier to clean than the Zyliss, but it simply isn't as good as the Zyliss when it comes to the one thing it's designed to do.",3.0
206,"This review is for those who care about human rights violations in China. The garlic press is designed and sold by a Kuhn Rikon, a Swiss company. However, the press is actually manufactured in China.<br /><br />It works well, and does not take a lot of hand strength to press two cloves. Nice all-stainless steel construction. Clean up is a breeze because the press design opens wide and allows easy access to all parts.",2.0
207,"We bought this item after seeing the review on America's Test Kitchen.  We noticed, as they did, that the finish on our Zyliss press (which we love) was flaking off.  The price seemed a little high, but it looked like a solid piece of equipment that would last for years.<br /><br />The build quality of the Kuhn Rikon seems great - this is one heavy duty garlic press.  It is super easy to clean - both in between cloves and once you're all done.  As with the Zyliss, you can press garlic without peeling the wrapper off.<br /><br />All that being said, I'm not going to be keeping this one.  It does not press as nicely as the Zyliss - the garlic goes everywhere.  I've also pinched the palm my hand in it a few times when squeezing too hard (to compensate for the poor pressing).  It hurts bad!<br /><br />After using many different garlic presses, I can say that this is better than most, but I'll be going back to the Zyliss - even if I have to replace it every few years.",3.0

The quality is outstanding and extremely well made, fits great in your hand and doesn't require huge pressure to press the garlic well.  But once the garlic is pressed, you are left with picking out the grate with your fingers.  We bought another for $5 at a culinary store that works just as well...but may not last as long as the Kuhn Rikon. Your call.",3.0

Later I pinched it so badly I had a blood blister for a week.  I've learned that if I hold it very carefully at the tip of the press I won't pinch but over the years I'm so nervous now I hardly use it.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRESS!",1.0
