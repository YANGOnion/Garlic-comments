0,"If you love garlic, if you love tools, if you love to cook . . . why don't you have this garlic press? I asked myself that once I held this baby. Thick, hefty (to too heavy) stainless steel, 308 I think, and fits the hand. Adequately long handles provides great leverage so if your grip isn't what it used to be, then this will help.<br /><br />Liquifies the garlic. Easy to clean; flips open and the breach is very accessible. Fit and finish is very high and quality is top-shelf. Pricy but what you get is a tool which can be handed down to another garlic lover.",5.0
1,"Very heavy duty/solid feel.  It is made in China but looks to be a very good quality.  The mesh part is on a hinge which allows it to flip out so it can be very easily cleaned.<br /><br />Did a pretty good job of mincing the garlic, but I still felt there was a bit of waste left behind (I peeled the garlic, but was left with a pulpy mat on the face of the mesh) - overall though it wastes very little garlic compared to a cheaper model I had.  Also does not have a large capacity, I had to cut a big clove in half to get it to fit, although I'm not sure that it is really any smaller than other presses.<br /><br />I think this is definitely worth the price, but the Susi 3 I had worked just as well or even better, almost no remaining pulp.  The Susi was a little easier to handle as well",4.0
2,"Why would anybody pay $40+ dollars for a garlic press you might ask?  Because it is that good.  I have had this garlic press for 7 years.  Before that, I owned several other brands costing far less.  The best I had owned to that point was the Zyliss.  There are 3 things the Kuhn Rikon does much better than the Zyliss.  First, it cleans up very quickly.  The main reason for this is the piece with the holes rotates so you can access both sides.  Takes maybe 30 seconds to completely clean.  Second, it gives you a lot of leverage.  You can even mince garlic when its frozen.  It is easy to do 2-3 pieces at a time.  Third, it is durable.  7 years later, it still looks and works like the day I got it.  No rust, no chipping and no visible wear.<br /><br />What is the bad news?  If you have small hands, it may be difficult grab both handles properly.  My wife, whose hands measure about 5 inches in length finds it a bit big.  This causes her to pinch herself.  The problem is that the top handle comes down over the bottom handle on the sides. If you struggle to get your hand firmly on both sides with some room to spare before pressing down, you can catch your skin as you press down.  I have probably used this for 1000 cloves and never had the issue.  I am guessing that somewhere between 5.5 to 6 inches is probably the minimum length your hand should be to use this safely.<br /><br />There is a point where this tool makes sense and point where it does it.  If you like the press several pounds of garlic at a time (say a bag from Costco), a food processor will do the trick in a fraction of the time.  If you only use 1-2 cloves of garlic at a time, this is probably just too expensive.  However, if you find yourself needing to regularly press 5-50 cloves at a stretch, this is what you want.",5.0
3,"In our family we cook with a lot of Garlic and have went through many other garlic presses in the past some within a few months, some have broken and some we have thrown out because of them rusting in the dishwasher.<br />So enter the Kuhn Rikon Garlic Press, sure it's almost twice and sometimes three times the price of other garlic presses on Amazon, I wanted to get something that would impress my wife &#34;Happy Wife, Happy Life&#34;<br />Upon opening it I was immediately impressed with the weight of the thing, it's quite a hefty press compared too others I have had in the past, also this thing screams precision (if there is such a thing between Garlic Presses) the thing just fits together, opens and closes perfectly no give or wiggle.<br />However probably the best thing about this press is the fact that after you have pressed a clove and you get the left over skin of the bulb left in the cradle usually you have to reach for a knife to scrape the old skin out, not with this one, the whole cage that holds the bulb when squeezing opens completely up and the used skin just falls out ready for your next bulb to be squeezed.<br />This is not the cheapest of Garlic Presses but you get what you pay for with a quality built excellent press that works perfectly every time, I generally look for items made in the USA but this is made in Switzerland and you can't go wrong with this or Rolex watches, both made with great care and quality.",5.0
4,"High quality item, larger than other garlic presses.  If you are pressing dozens of cloves frequently, this is a great tool.  But, it is clumsy to use and takes up more drawer space than the standard Zyliss.  It does a good job of extruding all the garlic, but the design is flawed due to ridges on the outside prevent all the garlic from being scraped off.  When smushing a dozen cloves, one after the other, it's not important, but for single clove recipes, it's a pain.  The hopper is not much bigger than regular garlic presses.",4.0
5,I ordered the garlic press I was using from Williams Sonoma about 26 years ago.  It was a bit aggravating but always got the job done.  My hubby of 5 years hated it because it was hard to clean so he gave me this one as part of my Christmas gift.  I am an avid cook and he is my volunteer sous chef/dish washer.  He decided on the Kuhn Rikon based upon the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen.<br /><br />When I opened the gift and saw the box I honestly didn't think it would be that much better than my old one.  Hubs used it first and raved about how wonderful it was.  I used it last night for the first time and boy was there a huge difference!  It is much heavier and presses garlic MUCH easier than my old one.  It is very easy to clean.  I was able to get much more garlic out of a clove than ever before.  I usually press garlic between 5 and 7 days per week so I am very familiar with the process and how much a clove contains (or at least what my old press could squeeze out).  I feel like I've gone from driving a 26 year old clunker to zipping around in a luxury car!,5.0
6,"This is an awesome garlic press.<br />Stainless steel, so no corrosion.<br />Holes are not too small, not too big.. Just right!<br /><br />Ingenious design, makes it a breeze to clean.<br />Design also gives good leverage and power for squeezing with ease and comfort.<br /><br />Everyone who uses it asks where I got it,<br />and I've given two as gifts to family members.<br /><br />My previous favorite was a zyliss, which i would still be using to this day, except it was made of aluminum.<br />The outer coating on the zyliss eventually wore off, resulting in black aluminum corrosion/juice getting in my food, which was not acceptable.<br /><br />I've had this for over a year with regular use and I'm delighted with it.",5.0
7,"Fantastic kitchen gadget!  I didn't think I needed an expensive garlic press, but boy was I wrong!  We're a family of five that enjoys cooking and have peeled and chopped a lot of garlic and ginger, but not anymore.  Peeling is unnecessary with this press making short work of a whole head of garlic (one or two cloves at a time) or many pieces of ginger.  Its simple, well made, easy to use and easy to clean - I really don't understand what makes it so good, but it is that good.  We're literally using twice as much healthful garlic with this press.<br /><br />The company has also been great.  The first unit that they sent me got a lot of use, but one of the well made hinge pins kept falling out under heavy use.  I contacted Kuhn Rikon and they immediately sent another.  That said, even with the hinge pin issue, I would not have returned this product - its just that good!",5.0
8,"Excellent garlic press. We use it all the time for dried homegrown garlic. No complaints at all. Easy to use, easy to squeeze with the curved handle and not too big of a reach to get the handle closed. Easy to clean, and as with anything, it is easiest to clean if cleaned soon after using instead of allowing the remnants to dry on it. We haven't used it to crush garlic with the skins on, but that's because that is the way we like to use it; based on how well it works, I'm guessing it would do fine if a single skin is left on a garlic clove before pressing.<br />Highly recommended for anyone who uses cloves of garlic. This press definitely is better than dicing cloves by hand with a knife and gives better results than squishing them with a mortar and pestle.",5.0
9,"Absolutely the BEST garlic press that money can buy.<br />Mechanical advantage is engineered perfectly for easy squeeze.<br />Press openings are sized just right for fragrant expression.<br />Clean out of bulk remnants is quick and simple, but requires some extra fuss for small remnants inside openings.<br />I've put through the dishwasher numerous times without signs of wear.<br />All stainless steel construction and VERY sturdy.<br />I wish it had slightly more beveling to the underside/inside edges of the grip for improved feel, but that's a minor quibble.",5.0
10,"This is my first garlic press so I can't compare it to others.  I am writing this review after using the press about 15 times.  The press feels sturdy and well designed.  Clean up is easy.  I haven't pinched myself with the press so I don't know if that should be a concern.  Peeled garlic minces easily.  Unpeeled garlic also minces easily however since the outer shell is left in the 'basket' subsequent pressings are a little harder but not impossibly so.  I also minced fresh ginger which wasn't too hard however it isn't as easy because of the fibrous nature of ginger.  Some of the ginger comes out minced but the fibers are caught in the basket, so those have to be removed on occasion.  What I do is mince ginger into a small bowl, saving the ginger juice then remove and cut the fibers and place those into the bowl.  All this was not unexpected .",5.0
11,"Oh, so THIS is why you pay $30+ for a garlic press!<br />I'm a garlicaholic. I must have tried just about every press on the market, including a tubular &#34;mincer&#34; thingee.  Nah. Yuck. The only other press that came anywhere near this is made by Oxo. This does an excellent job of squishing the garlic gloves, and while you don't need to peel the cloves, I generally do. (And yes, smooshing the cloves with the flat of a knife blade works, but then you only have smooshed garlic, not pressed.)<br />I've giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is still some &#34;mash&#34; that comes up the sides of the presser. But that's a small nit and easily picked. The fact that the mesh screen flips out for cleaning is a huge plus--no more wondering where did I put that little pronged cleaning tool or how do I get the garlic pieces that are caught in the holes on the inside.... You do still have to scrape&#34; the outside of the mesh where the mashed garlic comes out or drag it along the edge of the pot or pan, but you have to do that anyway with most of the presses I've tried.<br />Worth it....",4.0
12,"My only thought with this press is why in the world did I wait so long?? I'll admit, I was a bit put off by the price, but I had been using a stainless steel one that was very frustrating. I had also gotten a replacement about a year ago and it literally last one time. The bolts broke, and I had to throw it out.<br /><br />When the Kuhn RIkon first arrived, I thought - wow! This is a little heavy and bulky. Not one bit once you use it! It works just as they said it would (see the You Tube video for garlic press reviews). It smashed through a large garlic clove like nothing! Larger cloves do require a bit of heft, but so did the other one with dubious results. Also - no peeling! Just pop the clove in and you'll have lots of minced, squashed garlic instantly. I figure the amount of money I'll save in buying garlic will more than make up for the cost as the other press gave me practically no garlic from each clove. I can't wait to buy this for family.<br /><br />As an aside - check out the Kuhn Rikon can opener. Once I was looking for a replacement and a saleswoman recommended it (even thought they did NOT have it in her store...) saying, &#34;You'll never use another one!&#34; Right again, Kuhn RIkon, as there are no more sharp edges with their opener. Opens any can easily and safely.",5.0
13,"At the &#34;advancing&#34; age of seventy, I managed to break the handle on my previous garlic press, one that I thought was pretty sturdy.  So I was looking for a heavy-duty garlic press that was at least grandma-proof, and this one seems to be.  I like the fact that the part that cleans the press is attached and  pivots out for easy cleaning.<br /><br />The product description says that you don't have to peel the garlic with this press, but I have't tried the unpeeled garlic yet.  Most presses leave some residue in the chamber, and you can get more garlic out by using a knife to lift  and  rearrange the residue and pressing it again.  I'm figuring that more detritus in the chamber means less garlic coming out of the press.  But I promise that the next time I press garlic, I'll try the unpeeled garlic to see if there is a difference.<br /><br />None of the garlic presses have perfect scores, and if this one has a defect, it would be that it is a bit heavy and might require two hands to press, but I don't regard that as a problem.",5.0
14,"Yes, yes, there are those who say that it's too small to fit some garlic cloves into, or that it's hard to clean, or that it's too expensive, but you can forget about what they say.  This is the BEST garlic press you will have ever owned.<br /><br />* Sure, for some of the bigger cloves I might have to cut the clove to fit it in the press, but who cares?  How lazy are we anyway?<br />* It's not hard to clean, because you just open it up and run it under water and the garlic remnants come out; sure there may be a bit of garlic stuck in one of the holes, but it will fall out as it dries anyway, so who cares?  Do we have to be so obsessive?<br />* This thing is so well designed it presses-out a clove of garlic almost like a knife through butter.  It's that easy.<br />* It opens-up on a hinge so that you have access to the press screen to clean it out and you don't have to dig around into a compartment to get the garlic remnants out.<br />* It's stainless steel and not coated with some creepy non-stick stuff that you don't want to get into your food as you take a knife to scrape the pressed garlic off over your food.<br />* The handle design makes it easy to hold.<br />* There's no dumb separate plastic press cleaning device to drop down the drain as you try to clean it.<br /><br />What are you waiting for?  Yes, it's expensive, but this is one use-specific kitchen tool I will not regret spending some money on.",5.0
15,"I love the ease of use, cleaning and the overall functionality of this press.  I had broken cheaper ones and this one is solid and built to last.  My only complaint is that it will bite you if you're not careful how you hold it.  For some reason, the designers decided to ensure that the meaty part of the palm of your hand will get pinched when squeezing the garlic press completely.  It's easy enough to avoid and you won't make the mistake of holding this like a pair of pliers more than once (after that, I guarantee you will learn your lesson and never do it again - hurts like a MOTHER!).  But overall it is a great garlic press, goes into the dishwasher just fine and is a breeze to clean.",4.0
16,"Kitchen implements are a pretty individualized thing. Every cook is different, after all, and what works for some just doesn't work for others. This isn't the most ergonomic design, and it's really built for medium-sized hands for people with a reasonable grip strength. If you have a weak grip, you're going to want something with more leverage; if you have large, meaty hands, you'll have to take care that you don't pinch part of your hand in the handle.<br /><br />That said, this works incredibly well for me. The leverage is right, the fulcrum is directly over the clove, I don't get caught in anything, and I can very efficiently get through a lot of cloves of garlic with this. It will take one large clove or two medium cloves easily—you don't even have to peel them, and I often don't, because it makes cleanup slightly easier—and the result is a very nicely minced/pressed garlic.<br /><br />It is, of course, a garlic press. There will be leakage on occasion, and occasionally bits will jet out. This is common to all garlic presses, and it's more about the nature of garlic than it is about the press itself. That said, that leakage is fairly easy to deal with (the handle opens all the way, not only lifting the grating plate but exposing everywhere any escaping garlic might be so that you can collect it all).<br /><br />Cleanup is relatively fun compared to other garlic presses I've owned. When you open the handle, the grating plate lifts up and is ridiculously easy to clean out, especially if you've been doing unpeeled garlic (just pull off the peel under running water, which clears most of the leftover garlic as well). A vigorous rinse under tap water will generally do the trick. With other garlic presses, it's sometimes difficult to get the bits of garlic out of the grating plate, but this one is thin enough that there's no trouble at all. If you've been unfortunate enough not to clean it out immediately after pressing garlic, letting it soak for 30 minutes will generally free up any dried-on cruft.<br /><br />The construction is sturdy, and it feels solid. If you have an exceptionally strong grip, you could carelessly break this, I suppose, but it seems in no danger from me.<br /><br />I've owned two of these, and had no troubles with either one of them.",5.0
17,"Really nice press. The design for cleaning is brilliant.<br /><br />This is my second review of the press I bought last year. It turns out the press I bought via Amazon was through a 3rd party and a counterfeit. It actually worked very well, for a year. Then the upper handle splayed open and the two halves fell apart.<br />Kuhn Rikon has an excellent warranty, so I contacted them and sent them a copy of my Amazon order confirmation. Kuhn Rikon identified the seller as a counterfeiter.<br />Here's the great part - Kuhn Rikon is sending me a new, genuine Kuhn Rikon garlic press. That's amazing. The customer service is fantastic.<br />The lessons are: 1) If a vendor has a product at a steep discount, it might not be legit. 2) Kuhn Rikon has a great warranty and fantastic customer service.",5.0
18,"This falls in the buy once cry once category.  I heard this was the best reviewed garlic press from Americas Test Kitchen  a couple years ago and with previous experiences, decided to give it a shot.  I used to have a few presses and of those the Zyliss was the best (coating flaked off within 4 months).<br /><br />1. Works great on both garlic and ginger.<br />2. The easiest cleaning press I have ever used (Zyliss needed a little blue plastic piece with pegs).  Practically just run your finger over it while rinsing.  The part with the holes is not built into the cup portion.  It is a separate flat piece except for the short side ends.<br />3. No plastic or coated metal like the Zyliss presses.<br />4. You do not need to get the handles touching to do a full press.",5.0
19,"My husband and I are devout followers of Cooks Illustrated, so when we saw the video recommending the product on their website the other day, we were intrigued. But our initial thought was ""NO WAY are we paying $40 for a GARLIC PRESS. That's RIDICULOUS. Just... No WAY."" However, C.I. made a good point as to how various garlic presses can in fact greatly affect the taste of your food. If the garlic comes out too chunky, it can sink to the bottom of your dish and not flavor it evenly. If it's a mix of chunky and fine, half sinks to the bottom, and the rest burns too quickly compared to the bigger chunks, resulting in a bitter taste. But if it all comes out finely minced, it all cooks evenly and flavors your dish evenly, thus dramatically affecting the flavor of your entire meal. Being the foodies that we are, we were suddenly obsessed about getting the perfect mince on our garlic, therefore requiring us to get the perfect press. So we sucked it up and paid the $40. It arrived yesterday, and we are downright GIDDY. It feels amazing in your hand. It's heavy, and solid, compared to our lightweight former press. And it feels so good to squeeze. It feels good in your hand, and when you squeeze it, it has this satisfying sound and sensation of a soft ""pop!"": the clove bursting vibrantly inside the chamber. Then it all comes out just... so perfectly, you cannot even imagine. And it's a snap to clean. We kept popping cloves all night, until our dinner was obscenely garlicky. And it was the best tasting garlicky meal we have had in a very very long time. It really DOES affect the flavor of your food. Our former press was more of a garlic JUICER by comparison. It left a lot of the clove behind, and just dribbled out a ton of the juice while extracting very little of the garlic clove itself. But THIS... well... GOLLY. We are never going to use another garlic press ever again. Thank you Cooks Illustrated!<br />PS: After dinner, we admitted we would pay even more than $40 for this press. Something that we NEVER thought we would EVER pay for a garlic press before it arrived.",5.0
20,"I've owned other presses that are a pain to get clean -- bits of garlic always got suck in the holes and I had to dig them out with toothpicks. This press, however, not only does a great job with the garlic, the way it's built seems to make it far easier to clear garlic from the holes by just putting it under the faucet. The stainless steel construction has held up very well over many dishwashing cycles, and it feels great in my smallish hands.",5.0
21,"I love garlic but cutting it is always a problem for me. I do not want to dirty a food processor to chop one clove of garlic. This works perfectly for me and is sooo easy to clean. Open it up and  raise the presser and rinse it out after each use. If you leave garlic in it will dry and become like glue and will take longer to clean just because that is how garlic is on any surface, but of course if you later soak it a few minutes it would do if you do not have time to rinse after use. I saw someone complain about it being hard to press. Im sorry but if you have a hard time pressing this, even with a really big clove, you are just a complete wimp. Just use both hands for leverage, one to steady and one to squeeze, it is not rocket science. Most cloves do not require that though so it is only if you use a large clove.. Also it is not at all hard to keep the metal mesh part from coming up. Really you peel your clove, pick up the mincer, hold it in your palm like a trigger put your thumb on the tab, drop the clove in and that little weight will hold it down for the half a second you get ready to close down the other side and press.<br /><br />I said all this because I need no plastics but was concerned about some of the comments but now I see they are absolute bull pucky and I hate being mislead by unreasonable reviews by people who lack basic sense.",5.0
22,"After the finish on my 19 years old Zyliss started breaking down, I had to get another garlic press. We tried to go economically, but in the world of garlic presses, you get what you pay for. This is mainly because of the high pressures exerted on the handles of the press - the metal and construction have to be first rate. After going through two decently rated garlic presses I was disgusted with the way the handles so easily flexed (bad design for a garlic press) and decided to just spend the money on a garlic press that would last.<br /><br />This garlic press is made to last at least a generation. It is strong, relatively easy clean, and minces the garlic perfectly as long as you don't over stuff the basket (common sense). If you used minced garlic only twice a month, save your money and learn how to use a knife to mince it. But if you use minced garlic several times a week, BUY THIS PRESS! At $40 it is more of a commitment than a whim, but I believe it is worth it.",5.0
23,"I love this garlic press!!!  I've had many garlic presses over the many years that I've been cooking.  My last press was similar in design which I loved, but had a coating that wore off after a few years of use.  Without the coating, the minced garlic was unusable, as it was stained from the bare metal.  Stainless steel is the ONLY way to go.  It's clean and easy to use.  The garlic comes out nicely minced, and it is a breeze to get the garlic residue out.  It's dishwasher safe and fits nicely in my hand.  What more can I ask of a garlic press???<br /><br />This press is a little expensive, but it's built to last a lifetime.  I won't have to ever buy another garlic press again.",5.0
24,"Phenomenal device!  This garlic press will easily and efficiently handle medium and large cloves of garlic without having to cut them into pieces first.  When pressing, none of the garlic escapes from around the edges of the plunger, and the pressed garlic is of uniform size and texture.<br /><br />The press is made of heavy gauge stainless steel, so it's much beefier than the cast aluminum presses that most of us are familiar with. At 3 times the price of a &#34;grocery store&#34; garlic press, this is not an inexpensive tool, but it's a bargain considering how well it performs.",5.0
25,"Outstanding build quality with hefty gauge stainless steel construction throughout. Clever hinge lever design that requires less force and is extremely easy to clean compared to Zyliss Susi Deluxe with its detachable hole cleaner (which I lost after about 3 uses).<br /><br />The &quot;almost&quot; part: I have experienced pinching on my hand when using this press. Twice it's nipped the soft area between thumb and forefinger. I'll chalk it up to familiarization issues on my part for now, but will wait to see if I can learn the &quot;proper&quot; way to use it. Also, my adult daughter did not think the force required to use it was substantially less than other garlic presses, but I did (with my giant meathooks).",4.0
26,"For years I've used a traditional aluminum garlic press, and every day for the last twenty years I wanted a garlic press that was easier to clean. Look no further! The smart design of this garlic press makes cleaning a snap. The hopper (while remaining connected) actually ejects giving you easy access for rinsing (no more digging and poking). Now, while the design is great, it isn't perfect. With larger cloves, you'll notice pieces of the clove get smashed up the walls of the hopper instead of being pushed through (a problem I didn't have with my traditional press). Of course, this is an easy enough problem to mitigate by cutting down big cloves, but I think some tweaks the design could solve this (thus 4/5 stars). Even with this little annoyance, the time and energy you'll save with cleaning is well worth it. I definitely recommend.",4.0
27,"The Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press is simply the best garlic press on the market. The vast majority of garlic presses on the market, since forever, are not very well thought out or designed. They are usually too small, or have poor leverage for crushing the garlic clove, etc, The biggest sin of almost all other designs is that they force you to claw and scrape out the residue of the garlic clove and are difficult to clean. Not so the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press. It can handle several cloves at once, and the swing out basket and grate feature is both unique (does Kuhn Rikon have a patent on this? No one else offers this feature) and easy to clean. Great functionality and built to last. RECOMMENDED.",5.0
28,"For years, I faithfully stuck with my Zyliss press.  I'm a big fresh garlic user and it was so easy to use, but I couldn't stand how hard it was to clean - yes it came with a little tool but the plastic prongs would end up bent after so many uses, plus who wants to go digging for that after every use?  Also, I was getting fed up with the coating flaking off, then turning rough and dull.  I subscribe to America's Test Kitchen and they had the Kuhn as their top press.  It was time for a new one and I decided to go with it.  I'll tell you, this is the absolute best press I have ever owned!  Very easy to use, extremely easy to clean.  Only 'con' about it is, I wish the handles were a bit longer, other than that, it's great!  A bit pricey, but, so far has been worth it. Very highly recommended.",5.0
29,"I decided to buy a good garlic press after reading ""Eating on the Wild Side"" by Jo Robinson. She explains that allicin - the ingredient that makes garlic so healthy - is only formed after the separate components aliin and alinase mix and set together for a few minutes. The more thoroughly you mix them, the more allicin you get. Jo recommended a good garlic press as the best way to get the most health benefits from your garlic.<br /><br />I did a lot of research before spending money on a good garlic press. Over and over again I found Kuhn Rikon getting top recommendations. I own one now, and it's wonderful! I can mince an entire bulb of garlic in the time it used to take for me to peel and chop one clove! Using fresh garlic has gotten so much easier that I expect to do it a lot more often.",5.0
30,"Wow, this is the best garlic press I ever got!  I actually bought it for my daughter's kitchen b/c every time I've cooked at her house and got annoyed with her supposedly 'gourmet' garlic press.  This really presses the garlic through very nicely and cleans well in the dishwasher.  The finish on it seems very durable and I highly recommend this for anyone who likes to cook with garlic and looking for better garlic press.  I think I'll get one for my house, now that I see how this one puts my garlic press at home to shame.",5.0
31,"I dislike that garlic comes out the back and side walls, not all garlic is pushed through the holes. It gets messy this way, leading you to having to clean it out after 2-3 cloves of garlic.<br />The press works great otherwise. Be careful, you can pinch your skin while pressing with 2 hands if you can't completely do with one hand- not fun if you do get pinched.<br />BTW- the garlic comes out so finely pressed that we've actually begun to use 40% less garlic when cooking. The press increases the surface area of the garlic and extracts more oils from it which coats our food better with less cloves used. This will save us money in the long run, not that garlic is expensive but now we won't be wasting it either.",4.0
32,"I got this garlic press on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen. It's a great kitchen tool. It's sturdy and solid. The best part is that it cleans easily. No special small brush or other special tool to clean this like I did with our old garlic press.<br /><br />Update 1: After five months our garlic press broke. One rivet seems to have failed. I called Kuhn Rikon. They gave me the another number for the warrantee and maintenance department. They immediately offered to send me another one, free of charge. Love it. Cannot get better customer service than that.",5.0

I wanted to get something that:<br /><br />- was easy to hold in your hand<br />- not difficult or painful to press together (to crush)<br />- could crush both peeled and un-peeled garlic cloves<br />- was really easy to clean (without using extra accessories)<br />- quality made from stainless steel<br />- produced fairly even garlic pieces (because it makes a difference in your cooking)<br /><br />I found a culinary review online that basically ranked this as the best garlic press (out of about a dozen) and it ticked pretty much all the above criteria. And I have to say ---- it did not disappoint! My mother-in-law loved it so much, I went ahead and bought me one too! And it's great!!",5.0
36,"I've tried MANY different garlic presses in my life and this is a &#34;six star&#34; item. Spend a little more now and you will have a life long tool that works almost perfectly - All stainless -  Strong enough to hold up to the force needed to crush the clove - Enough leverage to make pressing cloves easy (one or two handed) - Large enough to fit large cloves- Completely crushes and separates the meat from the pulp - Size of the strainer makes a consistent size mash that evenly cooks - Cleaning is easily achieved since the strainer swings out exposing a flat surface so there is not basket to dig the pulp out of. Just rinse it off, wipe it dry and it looks like new... Get it, you will not regret it and I guarantee you will spend more on cheaper, inefficient presses over time.",5.0
37,"been using a 3 piece Italian Garlic press for 40 years.  It works well  but requires my superman hand grip.  My wife has been complaining about the strength required, so I tried this one.  It is beautiful y built and uses mechanical advantage well.  It is easy to use and easy to clean.  Because it is more complicated than my 40 year old, it is also slower,<br />If I was a line chef, I would use my 40 year old for speed.  At home, the KREGP is the choice, because it is easy to use and easy to clean, and I usually have the time. I suppose the only upgrade would be to a small food processor.",4.0
38,"one of my favorite kitchen tools. i somehow lost my grandmother's old garlic press which was wonderful and none of the three others i tried measured up-- until this one.  it crushes garlic without removing the skin (ok, so you have to use a knife to slice it off when it comes through the holes if you do it that way, or take the lazier way out and scrape it against the pan edge).. and you can open it completely and push off the garlic skin with one finger-- no scraping to clean it, no garlic stuck forever in the tiny holes, etc. expensive, but sturdy, and will last forever (unless you lose it.). i rarely take the time to write reviews, but this little gadget is just good enough that i had to.  buy it.",5.0
39,"This is a great garlic press.  It minces the garlic very easily, and it is well designed to be easy to clean.  It has a little heft to it, so I also like using it to smash my garlic clove a bit to easily remove the garlic peel.",5.0
40,"Ordinarily, when there are already nearly 700 5 star reviews, I wouldn't add mine, but this tool is just too good to say nothing about it.  I have used cheap presses, scratching my head and assuming my ignorance was the problem when nothing happened.  And I have used the really good-looking KitchenAid model, only to have the handle snap off after a few months use (KitchenAid did send me a free replacement).  This press is superb.  It is very strong, holds a goodly amount of garlic, doesn't take more effort than my now arthritic hands can manage, and I especially love how easy it is to clean.  It was worth every penny.  I expect to pass it on in my estate.",5.0
41,"This is a very good garlic press but there is room for improvement.  First the pros: the compartment where you put the garlic in pops out for easy cleaning.  It's entirely made of metal too.  My previous press made by Oxo had plastic parts and when it eventually started to chip off, I had to throw it out.<br /><br />The cons: the compartment is a bit narrow.  I wish it was slightly bigger so I can fit one large clove.  The handles also not made for small hands.  Again, to compare to Oxo, I like Oxo's heavy handles that sort of do the work for you when crushing the garlic.  With this, it's light so you really have to use more strength.<br /><br />The garlic itself that is extruded is fine.  Not very fine, but good enough.  To get very fine pulp, use a Microplane grater instead.",4.0
42,"We use tons of garlic and this is the best press we ever bought - and we have bought a lot of them.  Up to now, the Pampered Chef press was the favorite of my other half.  I found it hard to clean without the tool it came with.  He insists on putting everything in the dishwasher and it turned dull and made the garlic turn grey.  Yuck!<br />The Kuhn Rikon press is easy to use and super easy to clean.  Other reviewers complained about size, but don't mind cutting giant cloves in half.  Due to the way it flips open to clean, some of the excess garlic occasionally oozes out, but it's not a big deal for us.  Peels clean out easily and it comes out the dishwasher sparkling and shiny.",5.0
43,"Worth the money. Never thought I would say that, but it is true. I have gone through 2 other cheaper garlic presses in 4 years. The kind with plastic handles. I admit, I use garlic cloves at least twice a week when making meals. We love it. And the other presses kept breaking where the plastic handle met with the metal on the press part if it.<br /><br />So I consider this an investment kitchen item as it is all metal and therefore can't imagine it breaking for a very long time, if ever. I have owned it now for a few months and it does the job perfectly. I have zero complaints. I think this is the last garlic press I will ever have to buy!",5.0
44,"This design of this garlic press is very well conceived. It requires less work to press.  I am also using less garlic to produce same amount of the minced garlic that I need.  Cleaning is a breeze since the sieve hinges out.  Couple things that might bother some people. One is since the sieve hinges out, you will need to make sure the sieve stay in place before you put garlic cloves inside.  The other point is that larger clove of garlic won't fit, you will need to cut to half before put into the presser.",5.0
45,"This is a great garlic press. I had the same name brand product made out of plastic for over 5 years, we eat a lot of garlic so it was deffinetly very handy.  I dropped the plastic one and the handle broke, I was in the market to buy the same product but wanted something heavy duty.  I ordered this rpess and couldnt be more happier.  It is heavy duty, one solid piece and will last me forever.  I love it and recomend it to anyone who is looking for a professional grade press.",5.0
46,"I'm a musician (guitar/producer), so I'm a certified gear freak.  I research gear extensively to find the best in show, and then work my way down from the top to the price point I can handle, if I can't buy in at the top.  In this case, I had an Amazon coupon, which made this purchase a no brainer @ $11 out of my pocket.<br /><br />This is a near perfect Garlic press.  All stainless steel and very well engineered - very well thought out by a smart designer.  It does an excellent job effortlessly, and it's quick and easy to clean.  What more do you need?<br /><br />Since both handles are made from one piece of stainless steel, they won't break like other units that have plastic handles joined to a steel crusher assembly - Oxo junk anyone?<br /><br />At the full price, it's a bit hard to justify, but it's the kind of kitchen tool you can pass down to your kids.",5.0
47,"Ill make this review short and sweet. If your looking for a high quality garlic press that will give you easy, consistent results then buy the Kuhn Rikon. I have used a LOT of different garlic presses in my time including the R&ouml;sle and the Kuhn destroys each and every one of them. I actually just purchased my 2nd Kuhn Rikon Garlic Press as I took the first one up to my cottage and forgot to bring it back. I decided to just buy another one and leave my original one up there permanently. I have had my first one for about 4 years and it still looks brand new. This is impressive considering how much I use it. Its just built like a tank and it continues to press garlic as well as it did the day I bought it. In a world where it is increasingly difficult to make purchasing decisions, its always a breath of fresh air when there exists a product that is so head and shoulders above the competition. If only buying a new car were this easy.<br /><br />Bottom line - If your looking to buy a garlic press then buy the Kuhn Rikon. Its the best press on the market.",5.0
48,"I love garlic and usually put in at least twice whatever is suggested in a recipe.  I don't really like mincing it, though.  I'd used another more basic press before and it was okay - although the hopper was a bit small.  Then I heard about this one via Cook's Illustrated and researched it - it is pretty expensive.  However, I appreciate good tools and this looked like just such a thing.  I've been VERY happy with it.  It's  sturdy and well-built and I expect that it will last for years.<br /><br />The hopper is much bigger than most presses I see on the market.  I can usually fit a couple or a few cloves in there (unless it's one of those super huge cloves - those I just cut in half).  Plus - and this is the cool part - it flips open to make cleaning easier...which it really does.  You do still have to clean it, but it isn't hard.  I usually let it soak in soapy water as I finish my dinner prep and then wash it.  No biggie.  It can go into the dishwasher as well.<br /><br />I'm not particularly strong, and my hands are much smaller than my husband's, but I have had no problems working this press.  I will say that the handles do overlap so if you're not careful, you could pinch your hand a bit.  However, I've had this press about a year and use it all the time and have never had that happen.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />****update****<br /><br />KR also makes a version with plastic handles for less money.

So I did a bunch of research on google and youtube and this was the best garlic press on the market according to what I found.

50,"Absolutely the best garlic press ever. Do not make the mistake I'd buying the cheaper version of this bad boy. If you're anything like me, you are interested in this product because America's Test Kitchen gave it a wonderful plug. And guess what, they are totally correct. However, there is a much cheaper version that Kuhn Rikon  also makes. That is NOT the product ATK plugged. This is the product you want. It's solid stainless steel, so it washes incredibly easy. Not to mention the entire mesh basket part totally flips out to easily rinse off skin and bigger chunks of debris. The shape is very ergonomic, allowing for maximum pressing of the garlic.<br /><br />I know it's expensive, but you'll never buy another one again. This thing is built to last for life, and does a beautiful job.",5.0
51,"Bought this after I saw it recommended as the top rating garlic press by Bon Appetit magazine.  Had to talk husband into it because it was so expensive.  We LOVE it.  The heavy weight of the Rikon, and the perfect way it fits into your hand make this feel like a real piece of kitchen EQUIPMENT, not just a culinary tool.  It opens up completely and the screen pops out (stays attached so it won't get lost) to make cleaning a breeze.  Finally, it presses the garlic perfectly and easily.  We use it multiple times a week.  The Rikon is to garlic presses what the Kitchenaid is to mixers.  Best ever and a must have for anyone who cooks routinely with garlic.  We LOVE IT.  Great buy.",5.0
52,"My husband and I are garlic junkies. We put LOTS of it in everything. We had owned a really cheap press that was not dishwasher safe, even though I put it in there anyways, rusted, no self cleaner. I decided I would get this even though it was on the expensive side for a cheapskate like me. I LOVE IT!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Dishwasher safe (Big one for me. If it can't go in the dishwasher I won't buy it)<br />2. If you are having a lazy day it will press un-peeled garlic, just leaving a little bit behind<br />3. If you peel the garlic, this will crush it all, leaving hardly anything behind<br />4. Pretty easy to press even when packed full of garlic<br /><br />Cons:<br />Honestly haven't found anything wrong with it<br /><br />For someone wanting a good press this is it. No need to buy one of the more crazy expensive ones since this does the trick really well.",5.0
53,"This thing is a miracle.  It is super easy to clean, and super easy to press.  It can be used on two normal size cloves, with the peel still on.  I've used other garlic presses which hurt my hands, were hard to clean, or which had such small hoppers they took twice as long to use.<br /><br />Yes, this is expensive.  But if you deal with garlic regularly (and you should!), this is the tool for you.  You won't regret it.",5.0
54,"I really do like this garlic press.  It is large enough to crush several cloves of garlic at once.  The shape makes it easy to do so as well.  Cleaning it is easy, as it opens up wide so the you can get to everything.  It is also dishwasher safe, unlike many others that I have owned.<br /><br />  After hearing the recommendations from America's Test Kitchen, I went to go check this out.  I'll admit, the price made me think a bit before purchasing this.  In the end, I realized that I could either make my way through several barely passable presses, or I could just get one great press that should last the rest of my life.",5.0
55,"Works very well. You get the most out of your garlic cloves for sure. It is heavy, you can feel the quality. Easy to squish, easy to clean. Exactly what I was looking for in a press. 2 things to say about it otherwise--one review mentioned that the space for the garlic was a little on the small side, I would have to agree. Im not even using the elephant garlic--just the stuff from the produce section in the grocery store. Some of the bigger cloves have to be chopped in half to fit. Not a biggie. Also, it is so darn heavy it has bit my finger a few times when I was cleaning it. Again not a biggie- just don't let it slam shut on your fingers.",5.0
56,"I was expecting this to be the best garlic press I have ever owned. I researched it, and it is well reviewed. So, I like it, but it's also the first garlic press where I have actually pinched my fingers (thanks a lot, America's Test Kitchen). This thing is well made, pretty easy to clean, heavy as heck, and nice to look at, but why does the lower handle nest inside the upper handle (it only got me once).",4.0
57,"Great!... but careful of your fingers!  This is an excellent quality garlic press, however because of the handle curvature and overlap when closed you can easily pinch/crush your finger (which I've done several times).... sounds like an unlikely accident, just use a little caution when rapidly pressing a lots of garlic.",4.0
58,"I saw this on Cooks Test Kitchen and figured I would try it out since they reviewed it and rated it so highly. It's made of good heavy stainless steel and made in a way that you can just flip it open and spray it off to clean the garlic fibers and skins out. It's the best.<br /><br />This garlic press works so much better than the Pampered Chef garlic press I have. The Pampered Chef press is made of aluminum. When the paint wears off (it took about 6 months), the garlic reacts with the aluminum and you get a disgusting gray juice running out of the press and into your food. For this reason, I would avoid all aluminum garlic presses. The material is just not a good match for the job.",5.0
59,"I love the fact that this press opens up completely for easy cleaning. It will hold 1 large clove or 2 medium cloves. It does allow pieces to go over the sides, but the fact that this opens completely makes it not that big of a deal.",5.0
60,"We've had one of these for years and we recently ordered one to send to our daughter who has now moved far away from home.  We've put ours through the paces, to include repeatedly making a great leg of lamb that calls for at least 30 cloves of crushed garlic for the marinade, and it still looks and works like new.  It cleans easily because of the way it opens up for cleaning and it can be put in the dishwasher.  We've had several others and eventually threw them all away after trying this one.  Our daughter has christened it the &#34;garlic destroyer&#34; (must be said with an Arnold Schwarzenegger accent), an apt name that is now applied to ours as well.",5.0
61,"This garlic press is simply unbelievable! It presses easily, the handle is ergonomic and comfortable, and it cleans like a charm! I had been using a Pampered Chef press for over a decade and I thought it worked great. Compared to the Kuhn Rikon, it was clunky and difficult to press a medium size clove. I would buy this garlic press over and over again.",5.0
62,"This is the garlic best press I've ever used.  It easily presses a clove of garlic, and has easy clean up by swinging out the basket and picking out the skins.<br /><br />As mentioned by others it is large and very well engineered.  It also takes some pressure to squeeze, but I find it typical vs. other presses.  I have seen others with swing out baskets that also work well.  The only downside to this garlic press is that it only takes 1-2 cloves at a time.  However, if I had to save one thing from my kitchen as it was burning down I would pick this garlic press.<br /><br />*Added later* A friend bought this same press after the coating on theirs (Zyliss?) started flaking off.  The design of the Zyliss was better, but the coating flaking off was a little scary.  They bought one of the Kuhn and theirs wiggled like it was not put together well.  After they exchanged it they got one that squeaked instead.  As a warning, although the one I got was solid and worked great, my friend had two in a row that were not as good as mine.",5.0
63,"Easiest to clean of any so far. Great leverage and good capacity, but watch out!  the way the handles close all the way, I've &#34;nearly&#34; pinched my palm and fingers a couple of times.  Will need to see if I just get used to it.  Definitely the best so far though.<br /><br />We've used:<br />the Messermeister Pro-Touch Jumbo - hard to clean, required a lot of strength if you put in multiple cloves, and after a couple of years, the &#34;mesh&#34; gave way!<br />The Zyliss Jumbo - Also hard to clean and the finish oxidized raising concerns about it getting into food<br />The R&ouml;sle Garlic Press - Purchased locally at the same time as the  Kuhn Rikon Epicurean - seems a little harder to clean and lower capacity, but pretty good.",4.0
64,"This is a top shelf garlic press. It presses garlic easily and evenly, and is much easier to clean than most. You can press a few cloves without peeling them, and it can even handle small pieces of fresh ginger. It is a lot to spend on a garlic press, but if you use one a lot, it's worth the money. Hands down the best I've ever used.",5.0
65,"I upgraded to this press after having a cheaper metal press for years. I never used my old press - every once in a while I'd remember I had it, drag it out and attempt to press a clove. Then I would remember why I never used it - no garlic came out the other side, and I now had a dirty, difficult to clean garlic press and no garlic to show for it. Then I would go back to chopping and mincing garlic by hand, as that was easier. I was skeptical that garlic presses could work, as mine looked similar in how it functioned to this press, so wasn't sure what could be so much better. I was also mystified by the mostly favorable, but the occasional very negative review. I went ahead and got it, and could not be happier.<br /><br />It presses garlic with ease, multiple cloves at a time. I have pressed cloves with the skin on, and get reasonable results, but I think you get so much more garlic when you peel them prior to pressing that it's worth it. Cleaning up is so easy. The garlic doesn't stick to the stainless steel, so it rinses clean in a matter of seconds. The press part hinges out and rinsing it under the faucet is usually sufficient to get it clean. I would say it takes one to two minutes to wash thoroughly. It feels very solid and well constructed. I've been using it for three months and am hopeful it will last a very long time. One caveat - I do have large hands for a woman and could see it would be more awkward/difficult to use if I had smaller hands. However, even then I think it would still be worth it because the garlic is so well pressed. I'd rather have to use more force a few times than try to use a less efficient press and not get as much out of the cloves, or (horror) go back to mincing by hand. The press was constructed to work when the force is applied in the right place, and I think it's possible to figure out how to do that no matter the size of your hands.",5.0
66,"I have finally found the ultimate garlic press! The Kuhn Rikon press is easy to use, easy on the hands, and easy to clean. I have a collection of garlic presses (the William Sonoma Garlic Chopper and the OXO Garlic Press) and they are being donated elsewhere now that I have used the Kuhn Rikon press. All of the pieces on this garlic press stay assembled when you are cleaning, though the actual cutting blade swivels out so you can wash a flat surface instead of trying to clean garlic out of the &#34;bowl&#34; of the press. I find that the pressure needed to use this press is significantly less than either of the two mentioned above--nice for hands that don't have the strength they once did. This press will hold one or two garlic cloves at a time, but it is so easy to use that I can press a whole head of garlic in just a couple of minutes. Great product!",5.0
67,"I'm a huge fan of garlic.  In fact, the world would end a little for me if all the garlic in the world disappeared.  Thing is, with our household's copious garlic consumption, we found ourselves going through a lot of garlic presses.  Most of the time, I found OXO products to be pretty good, so at first I bought their garlic press.  But I found that the plastic sleeve kept sliding off.  My next purchase was an all metal one but the basket would pop out or the whole press would rust.<br /><br />Then I found this press.  It's got a nice heft to it and the press feels very well made.  The weight allows you to press the garlic very easily and I find that a good amount of garlic gets pushed through the press each time leaving not much to clean.  The fact that the basket is hinged (and flips out) makes cleaning very easy.  And the thing is durable.  I've had this press for over 2 years now, and it's the longest I've had a press without it breaking.  My only wish was that the garlic holder was a little deeper or wider, but maybe that would sacrifice the ease at which you can crush garlic.  Overall this press is highly recommended.  I couldn't imagine using any other press.",99
68,"I've owned garlic presses before, but they were so fiddly to clean and produced such uneven quality of ""mince"" that I just used a chef's knife to do my own. The problem there is that while I'm a very good cook, I'm not a pro, and my hand-minced garlic wasn't the best. But Cook's Illustrated recommended this press, so I gave it a try. This is hands down the best garlic press I've ever seen. The whole thing assembles and comes apart with just a hinge to keep it all connected, so pressing the garlic is a breeze. More importantly, thanks to its foldout design, cleaning up is an even easier breeze. You can get your garlic pressed and the thing cleaned and back on its rack in less than a minute. The garlic you get out of it is consistently ""minced"" -- it looks minced, not just crushed to bits, and it's of a consistent size and shape so it cooks up just right. I'm using a lot more garlic these days! If you're on the fence about a press, let me be the first to encourage you to get this one above any other. This is as essential a gadget to a non-professional cook as a good kitchen knife.",99
69,"I walked into a gourmet kitchen store looking for a garlic press, and since they were out of the one I wanted they sold me a garlic ""chopper"".  It was terrible.  It was mostly made of plastic, impossible to clean, and made rather large hunks of garlic, rather than mincing it.  It smelled up my whole kitchen since there is no getting the smell of garlic out of plastic.  After fighting with it for less than a week, I returned it to the store and ordered the Kuhn Rikon from Amazon.  It was twice the price but well worth it.  The salesman in the store tried telling me that garlic presses are no good, that they don't leave enough surface on the garlic to cook it properly.  Hence the chopper.  Maybe this is correct information, but I really don't care.  This press is stainless steel which means it NEVER stinks after being washed, and it minces garlic like a dream.  With the lifetime warranty it will last forever.  Now I can pitch that nasty bottle of pre-minced, refrigerated garlic that I'd been using.  Fresh is much, much better!",5.0
70,"This thing is magical. Seriously the only garlic press I have used that had ever worked and since the basket hinges out it is so much easier to clean. Also, since it is stainless steel, I can use it as &#34;soap&#34; to get the garlic smell off my hands so it is actually a multitasker! No more endless mincing, microwaving to help peel, or freezing garlic to make it easier to chop. Pop a choice or two, smack with a knife to peel, and crush them to tiny bits with maximum efficiency.",5.0
71,"I have had an OXO brand garlic press for a little of 4 years and had started to break about 1 year into its use. So I did some research and found Americas Test Kitchen and watched the review on garlic presses and I was sold on this product. So I bought it hopefully and it was exactly that AMAZING. One complaint is that it only crushed EXACTLY one clove at a time, but it produces no waste (garlic slipping around the edges). The mincing is uniform and extremely small so your food is not over powered. I would recommend this to anyone. Plus it is very comfortable in your hand the curves handle makes for easy pressing.",5.0
72,"I have been looking to buy a garlic press for a bit. After reading the reviews here I took the plunge despite cost.<br /><br />Why did I wait this long? It works as advertised and then some. Well worth the cost.<br /><br />I was doubtful about pressing unpeeled garlic but this worked like a charm. I can fit 4-5 small cloves of garlic or 2-3 medium or large cloves at a time. I was surprised how well this worked with unpeeled garlic. It produced a nice mash and was easy to clean out left over the peels.<br /><br />Unpeeled vs peeled garlic felt like it worked almost equally. Though multiple presses of unpeeled garlic don't require cleaning in between. As it is I don't feel the need to peel the garlic prior with using this press.<br /><br />The cost is a bit much but I feel it is well worth it. Easy to use, easy to clean and it just works.

The press is not flimsy - it has a solid build that will last years. The press is easy to use after you figure out the balance act of the opening. The garlic comes out finely pressed which beats my hand chopping and melts seamlessly into any dish you are making. No skin passes through this press and it is easily cleaned with a swipe of your finger, a rinse and air dry. Love it.",5.0
76,We have owned several garlic presses over the years.  This one is hands down the best ever.  We subscribe to Cook's Illustrated and we bought this on their recommendation.

77,"We used to have three Zyliss garlic presses, and had no complaints about them until I saw this beauty on special in the Gold Box and had to have it.  Once I held this smooth, weighty tool in my hands, the others looked cheap, their finish worn from years in the dishwasher, their capacity to hold a plump clove of garlic like trying to fit an NBA center into a MiniCooper - and they went straight to the trash.  The larger capacity actually allows me to press two cloves of garlic at once, and works just as well on a 1"" chunk of ginger.  A real time-saver, and exceptionally easy to clean, since the components swing away from the handle for easy access.  No digging out with tip of a knife.  The handful of reviewers who had a bad experience are clearly the exception here - they should have returned their units for replacement or requested a refund if they used Amex.  If you love garlic, you owe yourself this excellent tool.  And if you have epicurean friends, gift them - they'll be forever grateful.",5.0
78,"Sturdy, solid stainless steel, this garlic press is powerful and easy to use. One quibble is that the chamber doesn't hold the large cloves that my previous aluminum Zyliss press did, but I've no regrets, because the steel is better suited to a garlic press than the aluminum was. The aluminum began to oxidize and turn black around the holes within a few months of purchase. That's not an issue with the Kuhn-Rikon.",99
79,I bought it because it had a best rating from a cooking org. Just got it today and used it to crush a number of cloves for various vegetable dishes. Very heavy duty and solidly built.

When pressing unpeeled cloves there is some 'leaking'? or squirting around the sieve. On the other hand I have always peeled my cloves before pressing.<br /><br />The Kuhn Rikon Epicurean is a handful.  I need to use two hands to get a grip when the hopper if filled.  Not so much when pressing one clove.  It weighs in at 11.1 ounces.  Cleaning is easy, just a bit of wiping with a soapy cloth or sponge, and rinse under hot running water.  Actually, I have been able to clean it using just hot running water.  Generally, I drop my press in the dish washer just for food safety.<br /><br />Today I did a head to head test against my old 'no name' French garlic press.  The Kuhn won hands down.  Frenchy was more easily grasped in one hand, but held less garlic to be pressed.  The Kuhn produced a finer garlic product.  The French model still required a tooth pick to clean out all the left overs.<br /><br />Drawbacks/complaints:  (a)Please engineer the handles for a smaller hand - I am a 66 y/o male and wear a medium glove, sometimes a large. (b) engineer the press so that the 'ears' on the handle/pivot do not block the face of the press. They somewhat obstruct the use of a knife to clear the face.<br /><br />Fix those two 'problems' and I would rate the product at 5 stars at this high price.  Either way, this product is probably out of the price range for the average person.  Thanks for listening.  AND save the sales receipt and literature as the press has a 'lifetime' warranry.",4.0
81,"So I balked at the price... but it's honestly worth it.  After throwing away so many cheaper but way inferior garlic presses, I finally got this one, and boy am I glad!  This thing can crank out garlic and you honestly feel the durability and craftsmanship of this tool.  And cleaning it is so easy with a quick trip through the dishwasher (instead of garlic glomming all those spaces between the prongs that the cheaper garlic presses get stuck with!)  Now I healthfully eat more garlic all the time because this tool gets used all the time!<br /><br />UPDATE: August 2015<br />Still going strong after 4+ years of use. Excellent craftsmanship! We use this press frequently and have absolutely no issues. It's either being used or in the dishwasher. Strongly recommend for you garlic lovers.",5.0
82,"I don't know what took me so long to upgrade to this. It's great and saves so much time. Also, it's stainless steel so no rusting. Easy to clean, easy to use. The handles are great and fit into my hand. I believe any hand strength would be able to use it.<br />Highly recommend it. Don't know why some reviewers would say it's difficult to clean. You just flip it open and let the water run over it. The holes never get clogged. If one happens to be a little difficult, you just help it a little with the tip of a knife. DW safe.<br />I love it.",5.0
83,"I have a really nice old garlic press that works wonders for me, however it's a serious pain to clean two or three times a day, every day. That lead me to this one, which is vastly superior in the cleaning category, however lacks just a little in the fact that the seal between the hopper and the plunger could be a little better.  What I mean by that is that some of the garlic squeezes out between the hopper and plunger instead of out the front holes as desired.  This is not a deal breaker though-this thing is awesome, requiring minimal effort to squeeze and minimal effort to clean, and being very sturdy and well built.  I guess I do have one more suggestion, the hopper could be a little bigger.  I'd be willing to bet it's better than what you're using now.",4.0
84,"My wife loves this for her new garlic press.  She had a pampered chef one prior which she liked but it broke.

Buy this, you will not be disappointed if you are looking for a new garlic press.",5.0
85,"I love garlic, but hate peeling and mincing by hand.  This press makes garlic an option for everything . . . not that you WANT it in everything.  Pull out the garlic, grab the number of cloves you want, throw it in the press and poof - you have freshly minced garlic with the peel left behind in the press.  I use this gadget almost daily, and have for the past five years.  I make garlic bread several times per week - light coating of butter on the bread, and use the press to drop some fresh garlic on each piece, then swipe with a knife to spread it out - perfect every time and no work at all.  You will not go wrong with this purchase!!!",5.0
86,"I have owned at least 5 garlic presses and have problems or things I didn't like about all them.  I finally decided to get the best one as a gift for our son.  It would last a lifetime and is highly recommended by Cooks Illustrated.  After using his, I was sold.<br /><br />I had an adequate press from Cutco, but was annoyed that it did an incomplete squeeze.<br /><br />This is so easy to clean.  It presses the garlic completely.  I don't need to peel the garlic to use it.<br /><br />I am so delighted with the functionality of this product and the sturdiness. It is not cheap, but is worth the money.",5.0
87,"This is a decent press.  But after reading all the glowing reviews, I have to admit to overly high expectations.  The design is great for cleaning.  And it will press unpeeled garlic pretty well.  However a fair bit of garlic will squeeze out the rear sides of the press.  I think this is only natural since the tolerances aren't very tight between the solid plate of the press and the side walls.  I haven't used many presses so I don't know if this press is better or worse than the average.  But it does cut into the garlic yield.",4.0
88,"I bought this product specifically for juicing ginger root to make a Chinese ginger milk desert.  I read that most garlic presses have a more difficult time to juice ginger.  (This is the first garlic press I have owned.)<br /><br />PROS<br />The mechanical action creates leverage to more efficiently press ginger or garlic.  For ginger, it still requires a lot of force.  Garlic is pressed almost effortlessly.<br /><br />Solid and well-built.<br /><br />Round polished steel is very ergonomic in your hand.<br /><br />Easy to clean.<br /><br />CONS<br />It seem rather mechanically complex for a press, therefore more possible points of failure.  But it does have a lifetime warranty.<br /><br />If you compress the lever to the end, it is rather easy to pinch the skin on the palm of your hand so just be careful using it.<br /><br />It is difficult to dry all the inner mechanics.  I actually like to heat it up just slightly in the oven after washing to prevent rust.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this product.  The quality and good performance is worth the higher price compared to most garlic press.  It is stylish and attractive too.",4.0
89,"Ordered this item last night and received it today, Amazon you have really stepped up your game.  I bought this product after doing research at America's Test Kitchen website and my OXO Garlic press finally broke.  Although I have not used this item yet after a close inspection I know I will never have to replace it unless it gets lost.<br /><br />I use my garlic press nearly every day so it gets a lot of use and I generally press at least a couple of cloves at a time.  My OXO lasted about 6 years and for the price I have no complaints although it was too hard to clean.",5.0
90,Works great. Very sturdy (I've broken a number of cast garlic presses). No worries about this one. My wife says it's easier to press than others (there's a lever arrangement that gives you mechanical advantage in the last 10 0r 15 degrees of handle motion). The flip-out hole section makes it very easy to clean.<br />It's surprisingly heavy - hopefully that will translate to long-term durability.,5.0
91,"I tried a different garlic press before getting this one, but this one is so much nicer.  It's heavy, so you don't have to press as hard, and the hinged press plate makes it a lot easier to clean.  My only issue is that I get a lot of garlic that doesn't make it through the press plate, and I have to scrape and repress a few times to get the most from my garlic.",4.0
92,I saw the review for this on Cook's Country and that convinced me from the start.  This thing is amazing.  Works for both peeled and unpeeled cloves.  I do have to cut some of the really large cloves to fit fully into the hopper but otherwise it handles everything without a problem.  Opens up all the way for easy washing.  It is pretty heavy but fits in my smaller hand without too much issue.  The weight actually helps crush the cloves more easily so worth it.,5.0
93,"I purchased this garlic press after reading about it in Tim Ferris' The 4 Hour Chef. He was right. It is by far the best garlic press I have owned and I've had several. It is very easy to press and you don't even need to peel your garlic. My favorite feature is the easy to clean grate the garlic is pressed through. You can simply lift out remnants and when you are through - no scrubbing and digging. It is dishwasher safe, but I end up washing mine by hand since it is so easy to clean and I use it so frequently. I have given the Kuhn Rikon press as a gift several times and it is always a big hit. Buy one!",5.0
94,"This makes quick work of mincing garlic.  I really like it.  It's easy to handle.  The one thing I don't like much is that sometimes I feel more garlic should press through, and it's a little annoying trying to peel the garlic out of the chamber after using it.  I still really like it, though and find I don't have to use very much strength to operate this press.",4.0
95,"This has to be the BEST garlic press made! I can press garlic without peeling it if I'm in a hurry. When I do peel it, I get all of the garlic, not smashed cloves. I have two other homes and each one has this press even though it is pricey, it's totally worth it! I have spent $10-$15 on many presses before that did a terrible job so I figured I would never have to buy another one with this one! I love it! I always hand wash and dry it to make sure it stays new looking. What little leftover garlic remains can be easily lifted out for washing.",5.0

I hadn't realized how sick I was of my fingers smelling like garlic until I started using this thing. I shake the layer of garlic skin into the compost and toss this into the dishwasher. It always comes out sparkly clean. This is well made, works well, feels good in your hands, and has a nice weight to it. It's pretty pricy, but I'm glad I got it.

I kept procrastinating, promising myself that I would find a better one each time that I used it and then forget about it until the next time that I used it. Thank goodness the cheapie finally broke forcing me to buy a new one. After studying the reviews on Amazon, I decided that I would bite the bullet and purchase this highly rated (and rather expensive) press. It was a good choice.... the Kuhn Rikon is sturdy and well made, I especially like the swing-out grate that simplifies cleaning. I highly recommend this tool.",5.0
98,"The garlic press is pretty substantial in size and feels like it's built to military specs.  It easily crushes garlic, even with the peel still intact.

99,"Having only dealt with cheap or ancient garlic presses in the past I had a very poor opinion of them overall, and didn't consider a garlic press to be a tool I needed to own. In my mind they were ineffective, hard to clean, and basically weren't better than prepping your garlic by hand.<br /><br />However, my significant other really wanted a garlic press she could use despite, and after looking at the reviews on Amazon we settled on this one.<br /><br />I have to say, it's tremendously well designed. The action of the hinges is smooth and easy, it's got a big grip that fits the hand well, it takes relatively little force to fully press the garlic, and due to the way the pressing plate is separately hinged from the two handles it swings out completely making cleaning it a non-issue.<br /><br />I still mince a lot of garlic when I'm cooking, but when you just want some quick crushed garlic, this is the tool for the job, hands down.",5.0

Even though the instructions say you don't need to even peel the clove, I always do it anyway. The amount of crushed garlic that gets pushed though the grate is more than I've ever gotten before from all the other garlic presses, as it pushes all the available garlic out.

Ergonomic (old hands) easiest to clean by far of any press I've ever used, sturdy construction, and it works like crazy, squashing multiple UNPEELED cloves of garlic easily and cleanly. Have not tried it on ginger yet, but am guessing it will be just as good. It looks good doing it too, though that's frankly not a consideration. I have a feeling this is the kind of thing I'll have forever. Worth the cost.",5.0

It is easy to remove the remains of each garlic clove after pressing, making it handy for pressing multiple cloves.

115,"I purchased the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic press based on the many reviews seen here and other places. I checked it out because it's not cheap and I wanted something that would last a while. Most reviews were accurate. First of all it does the job, It minces garlic to a very fine degree.  I like sturdy equipment and this press is sturdy, strong and heavy. It's almost a man machine, but on the down side, it doesn't seem to have much mechanical advantage in its lever, and requires a good amount of hand strength, especially for the few last bits to be squeezed through. I don't have a problem with it, but my 16 year old daughter has a tough time squeezing garlic all the way through.<br /><br />Compared to my other garlic presses it may be overbuilt and too much for small, weak or arthritic hands. Like most garlic presses it's not all that easy to clean, especially if one forgets and leave any leftover garlic residue to dry, but it's certainly sturdy enough to put in the dishwasher.

I have run mine through the dishwasher many times with no ill effects. The only concern I have about this press is that you have to be careful when sqeezing it that you don't get the palm of you hand in between the two handles when they come together. I did this once and it was not pleasant. Other than that you can stuff this thing full of garlic and it has plenty of leverage to mince it.

It's more expensive, but not when you consider that this press is an engineering work of art that should last a lifetime.  I'm very happy with my purchase. I no longer have to struggle with getting pieces of garlic out of a press's holes.  In comparison, it's a joy to use.

135,"Once you use this product you'll wonder why you put up with all those other garlic presses.  This is so easy to use, looks so good, and cleans up is so easy. I've tried other friends garlic presses but they are no match. The Kuhn Rikon is a great tool for me and I just love it!",5.0
136,"I love it! Feels good in the hands, produces finely pressed garlic in a jiffy, and the &#34;swing out&#34; bit makes it easy to clean.",5.0
137,This is the bomb.  I bought this after my Kitchenaid garlic press broke at the handle.  I'm guessing because of cheap metal composites.  This unit is solid metal and has performed admirably.  The flip out grill makes it a breeze to clean.<br /><br />Would recommend and would buy again.,5.0
138,"Time saver, definitely justifies the cost (saves 3 minutes x 3 times per week x 40 weeks per year = 6 hours per year of time savings. Six hours at my wage rate of ~$100/hour means it's paid for itself &#62;20 times over).<br />Press gets most of the clove, and just scrape with a spoon or back of a knife into the pan.<br />Easy cleanup. Good design for intergrated hopper that swivels out to clean. Survives the dishwasher. Bought a second one for my sister.",5.0
139,"I saw other reviewers praise this press and even claim it can be used with unpeeled garlic. I have several other garlic presses and I knew that claim couldn't really be true. Well, it is true. Amazing, but I tried this press with unpeeled garlic several times, no problems. The press must be cleaned out with each use if you use unpeeled garlic, but what a time saver. The garlic comes out perfect every time. This press is easy to clean, easy to use, and very well designed and constructed. While it is pricey, it is an excellent product and has replaced my other garlic presses.",5.0
140,I was directed here by Cooks Illustrated. I didn't realize it when I bought it but the part with holes in it flips out so that it is brilliantly easy to clean. You just flip it out and wipe it off.,5.0

I am very happy. Even though I don't use tons of garlic, it is so nice to have the press clean up in seconds under running water. It's a luxury, but don't we garlic lovers deserve it?",5.0

143,"Just the BEST garlic press you can get. It's super easy to clean, and fully stainless steel so if you just use some soap in cleaning there is little to no scent. Perfect, perfect, and perfect. Would buy another one if I ever break mine (which doesn't seem possible given how sturdy it is).",5.0
144,"This is the best press I've found.  It is very sturdy - just fill the easy access chamber, close the press plate and squeeze.  No chance of breaking the tool.  Pressed garlic consistency is equal to or better than the others presses I've owned.  Clean up is a snap since the unit flips apart to expose all the parts.  Just wash off the debris and your done.  If a hole plugs, just use a brush - a quick swipe and it's clean - no digging required.  The downside, of course, is the price.  To me, it's well worth the money since I'll probably never wear it out.",5.0
145,"This is a great garlic press and nice tool to add to your kitchen if you are tired of chopping/mincing garlic with most of your meals. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because after crushing the garlic clove, you have to remove the leftover garlic skin before crushing the next clove for optimal results. The only solution to avoid this would probably be to peel the garlic prior to pressing, but it doesnt hurt to wish for something better. The crushing mechanism appears to work from brute force of pushing the handles together but it's not difficult at all. Very ergononomic, easy to use and clean. Take out the garlic skin and rinse. Or run thru dishwasher. Have had it for a year and it still looks brand new. Worthwhile purchase!",4.0
146,"I have had many different garlic presses over the years, not because I was collecting them, but because they would break at some point.  I think I may have bought my last garlic press now.  This one seems to be pretty much indestructable.<br /><br />Operation is a breeze.  This one is maoe of heavy stainless steel.  No more corrosion like the more flimsy alluminum alloy presses.  Ths one also is very comfortable to use (at least for me) and cleanup is a snap.  I have had a hand powered can opener and a vegetable peeler from Kuhn Rikon for years, and both are still as good as brand new.  They make good products that stand the test of time.<br /><br />If you are a fan of garlic in food (and I am), this is a well designed and well built gadet that may also be the last one you will ever need or wantr to buy.",5.0
147,"Absolutely LOVE this garlic press.  This press is top rated by Americas Test Kitchen and it doesn't disappoint.  Truly a one handed press even for someone older with a little less hand strength.  Works great, you don't even have to remove the inner skin from the cloves.  Washes and cleans up easily.",5.0

The basket opens up allowing one to just scrape the left over garlic out.  Not like other garlic presses that need to be cleaned out with a toothpick, hole by hole.  I think this is a great wedding shower gift.  Everyone needs a good garlic press.",5.0

150,"This isn't a review so much as a warning.  I bought this garlic press from a third-party vendor on Amazon, and it broke in a couple months.  The manufacturer, Kuhn Rikon, was wonderful about it but told me &#34;3rd party vendors are selling a counterfeit version of our garlic press&#34;  on Amazon.  They suggested only buying this on Amazon when it is both sold and shipped by Amazon.  This sounds like good advice, maybe not just for a garlic press.",4.0
151,"I've had presses in the past that I've chosen not to use because they were such a pain - I'd just end up using a knife. This one is easy to use, provides great crushed garlic, and is extremely easy to clean. Love it. Find myself using much more garlic than I used to and that's always nice.",5.0
152,Worth the money to have a press that my husband can't break!  We went through several cheaper models and he always managed to break the grate by cramming it as full as he could and muscling it.  It's true that this press takes a bit of grip to use and you do have to watch that you don't pinch your hands but I couldn't be happier.  We've had this for several years now.  Easy to clean.,5.0
153,Whoa. This thing is amazing. It's like you were driving around in a beat up 75 toyota celica and then got a new lexus. Smooth ride. I freeze my pre-peeled garlic and then let it partially thaw before pressing. A bit tricky in coordinating removing the debris but I'm sure I'll get used to it. The kwality is there.,5.0
154,"I've had several garlic presses over the years and recently had to replace mine.  I took a LOT of time to read reviews and even found reviews on YouTube from cooking schools and this piece of equipment is so far superior not just in my opinion but by people who use these all day, so the choice was easy.  As soon as it arrived and I held it in my hand I knew it was substantial and understood why so many said it would outlast any other.  It's design allows for pressing garlic without pealing and it works.  Cleaning literally could not be easier because the area the garlic is pressed through lifts (without the need to take it off so it could be lost) and you can easily wipe or rinse it off.  The design uses leverage in the hinges so it's 60% less effort required to push the garlic through the press.  Also, the garlic is SO evenly sized when it comes out of the press which is great, especially when you cook it in butter because you don't have small pieces getting brown and the larger pieces still raw.  All in all I couldn't ask for more in a garlic press.",5.0
155,"This is worth the price.  I was a little bit skeptical at first because it seemed expensive, but I use a lot of garlic so I thought I would trust and order one.  I have used it a lot already and it is worth every penny for me.  I do not have a lot of hand strength and have small hands.  I can drop 2-3 cloves into the hopper and easily squeeze  The design makes it super easy to clean.  If you enjoy garlic, get it!",5.0

159,"I am so happy with this press. Thought my pampered chef press was the bomb till in started losing layers of metal on the bottom where the garlic extrudes. My daughter in law's pampered chef press was even worse.

Even with some good brand name ones. I didn't want to spend this kind of money on a simple kitchen gadget but figured I had already spent that money on several garlic presses in just a few years. So I decided to invest in a good rated one and boy am I glad I did! This one will last for years with it being stainless steal. Washes up like a dream. Crushes the garlic effortlessly even with the peeling on. Unlike before with other garlic presses, I use the Kuhn nearly every day. Now we are healthier because I want to actually use this press to add garlic to all my dinner recipes. It's definitely worth the money.

165,"This is an excellent product. I was concerned that it would go unused in a drawer like so many kitchen gadgets, but that isn't the case. Other garlic presses that I've used required a tremendous amount of force, which can be difficult with arthritic hands.

167,"My previous $8 press had lasted about a decade, making me think about the cost per year of a garlic press.  Yes, this is the most expensive garlic press you will ever own, but it is incredible, and by the time you are done with it, it will average out to a dollar per year of use.",5.0
168,I order this because I have arthritis in my hands and have not pressed my own garlic for years have bought crushed garlic in a jar but did not like the taste.  Once I had this I could taste the difference between pressing it myself and from the jar.  Pressing it myself is much better and the best part is almost all the garlic is pressed through the press all that is left is a bit of skin from the cloves.,4.0
169,"I bought this garlic press about a year ago and love it. It works very smoothly and minces the garlic perfectly, and is super easy to clean. It has a nice weight to it - doesn't feel like it will fall apart if you squeeze too hard. No issues with putting it in the dishwasher.",5.0

I don't remember why I became interested in getting a new one but I discovered America's Test Kitchen is a great source for finding out what are the best kitchen utensils.  They raved about the Kuhn in a way that made me comfortable shelling out this much money for a garlic press.  Anyway, I've had mine for about 3 years.  It feels like a class act in the hand and works like a dream.  It is so efficient that there is barely any garlic left in the press to clean.",5.0

This press is hefty, and make quick work of mincing garlic perfectly plus it opens up to clean out every bit..",5.0

My old press was also painful to use on the hands when it came to pressing multiple cloves and/or to do it repeatedly.  This press makes it easy, fast, and comfortable.  Totally worth splurging on.  It's a buy once, and last forever kind of item, and I'd buy/reco this for others as well.",5.0

Finally, I had to admit that the somewhat pricey garlic press I had purchased just plain sucked. After perusing Amazon and reading a lot of reviews I decided on the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press.<br /><br />Holy crushed garlic! This baby presses the garlic and leaves little but the papery skin behind. Added bonuses, it takes little effort to use and, due to it's design, it's very easy to clean.",5.0
174,"Incredible garlic press; easy to use, easy to clean. The parts in the inside sort of fold out to make washing it off easier. I have not tried crushing garlic with the skin still on, but this does a great job if you peel first, which is all I can ask for. The one downside is that it makes a pretty fine crush, so if you are looking to get bigger chunks or slices in your cooking, this will not do the trick.",5.0

Can press a lot of garlics with no problem although some of it will stick to the bottom like on a cheese grater and you can easily scrape off with a spoon.  It is a bit of a challenge to squeeze for my hand as I have a smaller hand its arthritic but I think the squeezing may good therapy anyway but only use it once in a blue moon.  but for a more senior person with severe arthritis its probably too hard to squeeze (perhaps, unless their hand is big?)",5.0

Originally I bought the $20 plastic version of this press, worked well till the plastic broke on the side. I really wish I had just bought this press first.<br /><br />$40 may seem crazy to spend on a garlic press, but this solid, well built, metal press will save money in the long run. Better to buy the good tool once which will last, than to buy the cheap/crap tool several times as they break or don't work well to begin with. The only knock against this really, would be not having a ""push-out"" cleaning tool like on the Zyliss presses, but honestly as the press-plate will rotate out cleaning is still easier on the Kuhn Rikon.",5.0

I am in heaven favorite kitchen utensil I could press garlic all day.  Such a great find highly recommend this product.

I do most of the day-to-day cooking and I use garlic frequently, but don't enjoy having the smell of it on my hands all the time... this has eliminated that problem.  It presses the garlic easily and is also easy to clean (as long as you don't leave the pressed clove in it long enough to dry out).  All of the positive reviews are well-deserved... the quality of the construction and the design are sure to win this a permanent position in any kitchen!",5.0
185,This thing works really well. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is when scraping the garlic out of the dispensed area I tend to use a knife.

So it isn't a clean scrape of garlic...otherwise it works well.,4.0

Second, the minced garlic that comes out is beautiful and not a soggy, mushy mess. Third, it's incredibly easy to clean. The part with the holes lifts up, so all you have to do is to rub it with a brush for a couple of seconds and it's done. Finally, if you're lazy and don't want to clean out the leftover fiber after you crush each clove, you don't have to with this press. It still does a great job. In fact, you supposedly don't even need to clean the garlic before you crush it. you can put it right in.

For many recipes, I prefer the pressed garlic to garlic that is chopped by hand or in a food processor.  This press makes that much easier to do.  It is not as quite as easy to clean as my last one, but it is not all that hard.  Over all, it makes for less work in the kitchen.",5.0

These presses boast a simple, traditional press design and the best ones have a good fit and finish.<br /><br />But, in each case, I have ended up breaking out the perforated press area. When reading reviews for both the Rosle and Kuhn Rikon presses, I noticed a fundamentally different design, with a much stronger design for the perforated press area. On inspection, you find the Kuhn Rikon press offers a much stronger steel material for the perforated press area than many other presses offer. This is possible due to the ingenious double-swivel design.<br /><br />I can give the design 4 stars as I have not used the press for more than two months. So far, so good and I would give it five stars once I see this press perform for over one year.",4.0
204,"Don't think they could make a better garlic press than this.  All high quality stainless steel, super easy to press garlic both peeled and un-peeled.  Super easy to clean.  I've already broken 2 standard grocery store garlic presses, don't think this one will ever break.",5.0
205,"This puts every other garlic press I've used to shame! The action is smooth and easy. It extracts almost every little bit of the garlic bulb. It cleans easily. It looks like it would last forever. I've had many other garlic presses, usually I just end up smashing the bulb with the side of my chef knife and mincing it manually. Usually with a garlic press you leave a bunch of garlic behind in the basket (which makes it harder to clean), or you scoop out the residue and hit it with your chef knife anyway. This thing, on the other hand, leaves almost nothing behind -- only a light papery film on the swing open basket.",5.0
206,This garlic press works great. clean it easily with the back of a knife under running water and the garlic won't dry on it. If you let it dry it will be difficult to clean. The all metal construction makes it easy to put in the dishwasher.,5.0
207,Yes - Glad I paid the price. It's well designed...first thing I did was press a garlic clove with skin on. Easy to squeese and every bit of the garlic squeezed through. Cleaning was super simple and complete. Retiring my old press - and happy with this upgrade.,5.0
208,"this product is everything you want in a garlic press. easy to use and gets every bit of garlic when pressed. the only thing i dont like is if the garlic is just a little too big bits of garlic get stuck on the outer edge of the press. takes a little extra time to clean, but i will forgo that problem because it is the best press i have ever had. Was recommended on America's Test Kitchen show, and they have  never have been wrong.",5.0
209,"Finally, a strong, well made garlic press. I have owned many made of plastic, metal, etc., and at some point during their use they broke. This model was a little pricey, but I expect it to last a long time. It is very well made and all stainless steel. My last one was made of cast metal and broke at the hinge. This unit is very easy to clean as well.",5.0

After 5+ years of use, the metal part with holes begins to bend a bit from flat to slightly bowed, but the garlic press still works fine. It's not necessary to peel the garlic, but I usually do because it makes for less cleaning when I am pressing a lot of garlic.",5.0
212,"I had a fabulous garlic press and after 20 years it broke. I wasn't able to find the same type I had so I don't know how many garlic presses I bought trying to find one that worked as well.

213,"I bought this garlic press to compare with the Rosle garlic presses I own, to see if there was something better.  I like this press a lot, but not quite as much as the Rosle's.  We eat a lot of garlic and I've owned and tried dozens of presses; including Rosle, which I like best. However, I find this Kuhn Rikon Epicurean press easy to use, easy to clean (goes right in the dishwasher), it presses garlic very well, is sturdy and made to last.  I don't like the handles as well as the Rosle's, which is why this is second best in my book.  If I couldn't have my favorite, this would be the one I'd choose.",4.0

If you press garlic... look no further.",5.0
215,"Chef's Illustrated recommended this press and they are right on in their review. It is well made, has great leverage, and fits the hand exteremly well. The pivoting cup makes loading and cleaning a snap. The stainless construction feels and looks better than the chromed pot metal most manufacturers use and the removal of the plastic hole cleaners makes it look better as well. Since the cup swings out, it is a simple task to clean with a brush, making the unsightly nubs unecessary.",5.0
216,This garlic press is the very best and so easy to use!  I just love it.  This product was also recommended by PBS television show America's Test Kitchen and has proven itself to be of the very best quality.  The garlic goes through the press very easily and comes out finely minced as most recipes call for.  I use it over and over; it's also very easy to clean.  And it really is so very beautiful; I just love using it.  It was well worth the money spent.,5.0
217,"Slightly harder to use than the standard because of the multiple moving parts and some slippage of contents up the sides.  However, it makes good pressed garlic without pulping it and with the press holes swinging free from the cavity the cleanup is really much easier. I have both  in the drawer now and use this one so I suppose that is as strong an endorsement as any.",4.0
218,"Works great, relatively easy to clean, and sturdy. I previously had an OXO press and this one is superior. It easily presses fresh garlic, but I found that I must slightly thaw frozen garlic to get it to work properly, which is understandable. I say slightly thaw because fully thawed garlic tend to be too mushy and won't pass through the device very well. I've also tried to use it with ginger, but it doesn't work as well.",4.0

I was steptical when reviews states<br />it will crush garlic UNPEELED, but it does and it does well and with ease!<br /><br />I'm having a grand old time, using garlic in so many receipes!  SO easy to clean<br />and it ""flips"" open and all the parts are exposed for easy soap and rinse.<br /><br />Very please with the quality of workmanship!  Solid state, stainless, will provide<br />(hopefully) years of use.

I do like the fact that it's easy to clean and has a nice sturdy design so I'm sure it will outlast me.  If you need a garlic press this is the one that Cooks Illustrated recommends and I'm happy I took their advice.  Give it a try you'll probably be happy you did.,4.0

FINALLY, a company that has actually thought through the process of designing a press that works extremely well, is ultra easy to clean, and comfortable to use.

224,"Wasn't really shopping for a new garlic press but...I read about this garlic press in Cook's Illustrated Magazine, I was intrigued so I read some other reviews on Amazon, looked at my current press (noticing some garlic remnants still present from its last usage...) and decided it was time to give a new one a try.  I have now used this press many times and can honestly say that it is everything the other reviews said it would be.  It does a great job on the garlic and clean-up is a snap.  My old garlic press was also a handle model and is a huge pain to clean, the ease of cleaning the Kuhn alone is worth the purchase.  My old one is still in the drawer but only for back-up.",5.0

I found great reviews on this unit, with a few complaints about needing 2 hands to operate it. I ordered it and upon arrival I tested it out right away. I liked the fact that the basket would flip out for easy cleaning, and especially that the unit was made from stainless steel. I prefer to stay away from any devices made of aluminum that comes in such close contact with my food. I found this unit to be easy to use, easy to clean and I look forward to many years of fresh garlic! Only one addition I would add to the process would be to peel the cloves before use in order to maximize yield. Makes for easier cleaning as well.",5.0
227,"I found out about this garlic press from America's Test Kitchen.  I have used several other garlic presses.  This one works by far the best, and is easy to clean.  It was such a great buy.  It is strong and sturdy and still works like new even after more than a year's worth of use.",5.0
228,Love this garlic press. We use garlic a lot so we needed a device that could hold up to mincing a lot of garlic at a time. This is a fabulous press! Can go through clove after clove and it doesn't come pouring out the sides like our old one. Really gets almost all the clove through as well and easy on the hands.,5.0

I had recently purchased another one which I loved, but it broke after only a month of use.  I did my research because I wanted the very best.  I have had this press for a year or two now, and my husband is getting tired of hearing me say how much I love my garlic press.  I will never have to buy another one.  It's easy to use and easy to clean.  It is definitely well worth the money spent.",5.0
231,"This is simply the best garlic press ever.  Where have I been?!  Extracts all of the clove but the outer skin, and easy to clean.  I've stopped mincing garlic and use this whenever garlic is called for.  Heavy-duty and will last forever.  NO PLASTIC PARTS!",5.0
232,"I love, love this product!  I already own one but when I saw the price with the Black Friday discount, I bought another to have on hand!!  It is very durable, easy to clean and is the cadillac of garlic presses, pure and simple.  I highly recommend it!!",5.0
233,"I never thought I would get so excited over a simple garlic press -- and a very expensive one at that! Nevertheless, this is superbly engineered tool that works precisely as it should. It presses each clove of garlic thoroughly, and there is no need to peel the cloves beforehand. It is comfortable and fun to use, fast, efficient, and surprisingly easy to clean. Although it is pricey, it is one of the few kitchen gadgets that I can honestly say has been worth every penny. I use this almost every day -- in fact, I find myself adding garlic to dishes just so I can use my Kuhn Rikon garlic press! If you are seeking the finest garlic press made, look no further.",5.0

236,Broke my favorite garlic press and was in need of a new one.  Went to several stories locally and couldn't find a stainless steel garlic press anywhere.  I use mine alot and wanted something that would hold up for a long time.  This one is great so easy to use and comes out fast and perfect.  Clean up is easy the way this opens up completely allowing you to just rub the excess garlic stuck on the grater easily.  A little pricey but worth it.,5.0

238,"This garlic press was given to me as a gift and I wish that I'd thought to spend the extra money on a good quality one years ago.  I happen to know that my friend paid quite a bit more for this item, so this amazon price is pretty good.  Every few years my run-of-the-mill cheapo versions would break at the connecting point.  I'd have to go out and search for another one with thick handles because I have arthritis in my hands and need thick grips to be able to use it comfortably.<br /><br />This is definitely a KICK-*** garlic press.  It's the best one I've ever owned and it's jumped to the top of my list of favorite kitchen items.  I LOVE IT.  It also happens to look rather elegant.<br /><br />Not only does it press the garlic clove completely flat -- with ease!, even for a weak-handed arthritic like me! -- but you just have to flip it open and scrape the thin film of garlic skin into the compost pail with a nice flat knife blade.  Dead easy.  And when you wash it, the high quality metal does not grab little threads of garlic and hold onto them, the way the cheapo ones do.  I haven't had to use a brush on it yet, though I have been giving it a quick rinse as soon as I scrape out the garlic skin.<br /><br />Wonderful.  Logical.  A dream to clean.  What more could you ask for?",5.0
239,"This is a good garlic press.  It presses easily and completely and is not difficult to clean.  The bottom of the hopper flips up and the garlic remains can be rinsed out and brushed out with a toothbrush.  However, the real problem with this press is that the front of the hopper is not closed.  Consequently, as you squeeze down on the lever, garlic presses out of the front and around the plunger, as well as through the holes at the bottom.  It does a good job of mashing up the garlic, but it is not all coming out the bottom.  Otherwise, it is a nice press.",99

The old one had the little plastic cleaning gizmo that, due to extensive use, has half of the prongs bent or missing.<br /><br />The Kuhn Ricon press handles larger garlic cloves, is easier to operate (less grip force required), and clean up is especially simple.  No tools are required, just open it all the way and rub with your fingers under running water for a second or two.<br /><br />The all stainless-steel construction seems to be very solid.<br /><br />Not inexpensive, but is much easier to operate and clean so I feel it is a good value.",5.0
241,"I was making a nice Pad Thai, when my Mother's old garlic press succumbed to a combination of aluminum alloy (I think), the texture of ginger and the longevity of the press itself.  I thought to myself, I need stainless steel - oh snap!  I'll admit the price is seemingly quite steep for something you can get most places for like $13.  When I got it in the mail, the part that the object is pressed through looks a bit flimsy.  My worries were squelched very quickly.  This press can most likely run a rock through it.  The portion I thought flimsy, can lift up for a worry free cleaning (unlike the broken one)...and the handles are nice and thick for an easy grip.<br /><br />If you love fresh garlic or GINGER! this press is a must have :-)<br /><br />P.S. - go into your fridge and throw away all of that minced garlic in a jar nonsense, and go cook something!",4.0

Cleanup is also very easy, as the peel just pops out (where in other presses you sort of have to fish it out from the container). A+ and totally worth the money.",5.0

Fresh garlic is beneficial for the body and since I'm obsessed with garlic anyway, why not invest in a product that will last me for years? I have never had or used a garlic press and this one went beyond expectation! I am very pleased and about to go use it now to add flavor to my chicken and kale casserole!  There were complaints about difficulty pushing the press to crush the garlic, and this may be true for smaller individuals. I'm a &#34; bigger&#34; person so I had no problem crushing garlic and I loved that I didn't have to peel the garlic ( that's my favorite part).

It handles several cloves of garlic quite easily. But the best feature of all is that when you pull the two handles apart for cleaning, the grate swings out, so you can clean it oh so easily! No more using toothpicks to push the leftover garlic through tiny holes. I used to leave my press soaking for a couple of days because I didn't want to spend the time to clean it, and neither did anyone else in my house. Now it's such a breeze that I am glad I was willing to spend a little more.<br />The only downside is that I have tiny hands, so if I put too much in, it makes it more difficult to squeeze - someone else made the same comment, but, honestly, that's going to be true of just about any utensil like this.<br />Make your life a little bit easier and enjoy garlicking up your meals (you can use this with shallots, ginger, and host of other foods, too), knowing that the clean-up won't take long!",5.0
254,"This is the best garlic press I have ever owned. It is super sturdy & a beautiful stainless steel kitchen gadget. It presses the garlic beautifully and without having to use extreme pressure or force. The garlic comes out completely minced, so you don't waste any garlic. The only con is that you can only press one or two cloves at a time because the sieve is small,  but since it works so beautifully, quickly, and effortlessly, that is not a major problem. It also cleans very nicely since the sieve pops out for cleaning. I would recommend this Kuhn Rikon Garlic Press to everyone that loves to use garlic in their cooking. Since it is completely stainless steel with no rubber or plastic you must be careful when squeezing the handles so not to pinch your skin.

I have not yet tried it with ginger root, but am sure I will soon as it is advertized to work well pressing ginger. The only small quibble is that the basket sometines pops up when loading garlic, but this is the feature that also makes for easy cleaning.",5.0
263,"I broke two garlic presses before I finally splurged on this one. Well worth the money.<br /><br />I use garlic nearly every time I cook a dinner, so this gadget gets fairly heavy use and a bit of abuse because I don't always peel my garlic before mincing it. Peeled or not peeled, the garlic ends up finely minced every time. A little flesh and juice will leak out of the sides when you mince, but I haven't met a garlic press without that problem.<br /><br />Cleaning takes a few seconds since I don't have to dig my fingers into a cavern to extract the garlic residue from the grate. The grate sort of flips out.<br /><br />This garlic press has lasted  me several years so far and is still going strong. I like it so much that I've given it as a gift to other home cooks who are garlic lovers. I'm ordering another one right now for Christmas.",5.0

265,"This is a great product!  I hesitated a bit because of the price but it was very well rated by Cooks Illustrated.  And they usually don't steer me wrong!  It's heavy, well made, easy to clean (a key component of a garlic press) & seems like it will last a long, long, time.  And as it's stainless, it helps remove the garlic smell from your fingers while you wash it. Most importantly, it blows through garlic with minimal effort and great results.  My only minor complaint is I've managed to catch my fingers in the handle while crushing garlic a couple of times.  But that is definitely an 'operator error' issue and not the fault of the garlic press! So, if you're debating this purchase.....go for it - I don't think you'll be sorry.",5.0

If you have any knife skills whatsoever it will be quicker to just chop the garlic with a knife.  Still, I couldn't be happier with it.<br /><br />I should probably mention that while I found this product easy to use, I am a large male with big hands and strong preference for garlic in nearly liquid form.",5.0
274,"Really nice piece to add to a busy kitchen. You don't have to peel the garlic if you don't want to. Although it does work out a little better to peel it first. Sturdy. I chose this model over some of the other imported premium garlic presses because it seemed easiest to clean. t flips open in 3 distinct pieces so you can get right in there and clean the garlic out under running water. if mine broke, I'd replace it immediately.",5.0
275,"After a review by Cooks Illustrated (my bible), I decided to buy.  Definitely worth the extra money.  Sturdy, easy to use and clean, and works like a champ.  My only nit to pick would be the crushing basket doesn't hold that many cloves.  The best feature is that it is EASY TO CLEAN and get all the bits out after use.  Love it!  Consider no other product.",5.0
276,"I don't know why I'm bothering to write another 5 star review for this thing other than the fact that it's awesome.  Simply pulverizes the garlic, it's easy to clean, and doesn't require a lot of pressure.  In my opinion it's as close to perfection as a garlic press can be.",5.0
277,"This lives up to its rating...the first garlic press I've ever owned that is easy to clean and actually works! What I didn't know from all the reviews is that it's one piece. That makes it SO much easier to clean up. Very ingenious design that swings the hopper out. Well, well worth every penny.",5.0
278,"I purchased this after reading review by Cooks Illustrated. It was much easier to squeeze than many that I've owned.  My previous garlic press had a plastic cleaning tool that fit into the little holes and pushed out the garlic still remaining, but the press was starting to discolor and pit after being in the dishwasher a number of times.  This Kuhn Rikon doesn't have the discoloration problem because it's stainless steel and it cleans pretty easily because the part with the holes swings out (but not completely removable so it won't get lost) and since the surface is so slick (I supposed because it's stainless) the remaining garlic is easily removed, and easily fits in dishwasher.  The hopper is a little smaller than I'd like, but still adequate, and a small bit of garlic did ooze out of the side during use.  It worked well with both peeled and unpeeled garlic.  The Cooks review claimed the pressed garlic would be finely minced, not smushed, but my garlic came out partially smushed.  It's a bit expensive, but its stainless steel construction and ease of use are significant factors (as my ""squeeze strength"" has diminished with age)so I would purchase it again.",4.0
279,"This is my third garlic press in three years. My other two (one OXO and the other unsure of brand) had issues with the coating flaking off of the basket part. I don't want weird stuff in my food. So...I was looking for a stainless steel model that was also comfortable to use.<br /><br />The Pros: This press effectively presses garlic - and makes consistently sized pieces.<br />It is easy to clean - the basket swings out for easy access.<br />It is easy to use - I don't need to put very much pressure on it to press the cloves through.<br />It is attractive.<br />It is stainless steel so there should be no finish-flaking here.<br />It feels like high quality - so for now, I think that it is a lifetime-type purchase,<br /><br />The cons: I wish the hopper were just a bit larger - it only holds one giant clove, or a couple of small-medium sized cloves.<br />What everyone says about the press pinching your hands is true - it will pinch your hands if you aren't careful. For me, the other benefits outweigh this inconvenience, I just hold it is a way that I won't get pinched.<br />It was pricey - this is only a con is the press poops out after a couple of years. I'll amend the review if this happens.",5.0

282,"I bought this garlic press because it's made of stainless steel.  Its predecessor in our kitchen, a Zyliss, worked fine, but the coating wore away after a few years and the result was discolored garlic.  I liked the idea of a press that would last indefinitely -- not so eco-friendly as chopping the garlic with a knife, but better than regularly disposing of a piece of metal junk.<br /><br />What I didn't anticipate was how well-designed the Kuhn Rikon is and how nice it is to use.  It has a good, heavy (but not too heavy), well-built feel.  It fits comfortably in my women's size 7 hand and is easy to squeeze.  Though I have weaker-than-average grip strength, I have no trouble using it.  I've never pinched my hand as some users report, nor do I find that the crushed garlic squeezes out the front or sides. The flip-out screen completely eliminates the usual poke-with-a-knife procedure for cleaning the hopper.  You just hold the press under running water and quickly rub away the left-over skin. Since I use it several times a day, I don't put it in the dishwasher -- just rinse under warm water and let it air dry.  And, no, I don't think $30 is a lot for a well-designed tool that is used daily and (knocking wood here) will last for years.  I think it's cheap at the price!",5.0

It is quite easy to clean, can be put in the dishwasher and the finish doesn't wear away.

Another press of mine always had lots left over, that you needed to nudge back into the hopper, so that you could try again to push it through.  With the Kuhn, surprisingly little escaped being pressed.<br /><br />In the hand it's solid but not hefty, and the hinge movement with the hopper screen flip out, is smooth and feels very well engineered and executed.  In other words, this doesn't feel or behave like some dorky bit of over-engineering; having the screen hinge and flip out just makes brilliant sense, and truly, cleaning it is a snap.",5.0

The press does open fully to make cleaning easier, but when using it for a recipe that calls for more than a clove of garlic, I've found that the cleaning isn't as simple as a ""rinse"" under the faucet. The press also boasted that it required less effort, but I haven't noticed any substantial difference. Still, an excellent press overall.",4.0

It's a different garlic than grown in California. Look it up, don't be fooled!",5.0
320,The best feature is the leverage you get when squeezing the press.

322,"This is a very solid piece of engineering that does its job well. It's incredibly sturdy and very easy to clean. The one quirk is that you probably want to hold it upside-down when using it, so the minced garlic doesn't wind up trapped in the slot by the handle.",5.0

Results are near perfect, and the ingenious design allows the easiest cleaning imaginable.  Note that the item is made in China, but it is heavy and appears sturdy.  Five stars!",5.0
359,"I like this garlic press a lot. Great press! Fast and easy to use.  My only criticism is that the coating seemed to get scratched and etch after the very first time it was placed in the dishwasher.  So I would recommend hand washing only! And it should really be advertised as such.  Otherwise, I like the product.",4.0
360,The reviews were right. I've tried several garlic presses and this one is a keeper. It works well.,5.0
361,"It's a curious if elegant study in leverage and utility. Sure, it'll handle clove after clove of almost any size. But it unfolds to permit complete & easy cleaning with brush or fingers. All stainless too. Believe what everyone says about it--if you use fresh garlic and don't slice it, you need this utensil!",5.0
362,"This is our second purchase of this item, and we will never be without this garlic press.  Our previous one was &#34;gifted&#34; to our daughter and son-in-law and we were bereft without it.  No other press measures up.  This is the ultimate.",5.0
363,Love the product. They put some annoying hard to get off sticker on it though. Not sure what product manager was thinking. Product gets a 5. Labeling gets a 1.,4.0
364,"I love how solid this is, how easy it is to put large cloves of garlic into it, and how incredibly easy it is to clean. It also rarely wastes any by letting it squirt out the sides during pressing. We already ate a lot of garlic, but now I find myself looking for excuses to use more.",5.0
365,"I have been peeling and pressing garlic since I was knee hi to a grasshopper and this is the ultimate press.<br /><br />1) Easy to crush whole cloves, you don't have to be a body builder.<br /><br />2) Maximum garlic extracted<br /><br />3) Good texture consistency<br /><br />4) Very high quality stainless steel<br /><br />5) Very, very easy to clean<br /><br />Now I wish that they made all cooking tools as well has this press.  The design should be given some sort of award.",5.0
366,"This is the case of ""you get what you pay for"".  Expensive, but worth it.  This may be the last garlic press I will need to buy. It is built like a tank!  Very hefty and looks good, too.<br /><br />A clove (sometimes two- it has a bigger well capacity than my previous press) with it's casing will press right through.  I especially love that it is very easy to clean.  The interior perforated plate is hinged and will rotate around, allowing you to get to the front and the back of the perforated plate for easy cleaning.",5.0
367,"This is heavy duty, I can not really envision a situation where this would break or wear out, ever.  It is efficient and doesn't leave a lot of unused garlic in the cavity.  I do usually scrape it across with a knife or against the edge of the pan to get off all of the garlic that was pressed out.",5.0
368,It's everything is says it is !  Easy to use and CLEAN !  No more light weight tools.,5.0
369,"I have purchased two of these now.  The second as a gift I was looking for a high quality press and this is it.  Not only does it press garlic very well, it's very easy to clean.",5.0
370,This is a high quality garlic press and because its made from stainless steel; all you have to do is rinse it under water and let it dry. It will not stain or absorb garlic odor.,5.0
371,This is the best garlic press I have ever used.  Easy to clean and nice and strong.  I've had mine for about 10 yrs and I got this to give to my nephew.,5.0
372,"This garlic press is wonderful. Easy on the hands, it will take a large (not elephant garlic) clove with no problem. You can press cloves with or without skin. The size and consistency of the pressed garlic is great. As America's Test Kitchen reports, because of the size of the pressings and the preservation of oils from the clove used with this press, you get a much fresher garlic taste when cooking or when press directly into salads.<br /><br />The clean up is a breeze with the flip-out stainless steel basket. This is a pleasure to use and you will not be disappointed. Definitely worth the extra money if you like garlic.",5.0
373,I bought long time ago this garlic press and I consider that is the best of the best.  Excellent!!!.I have bought others brands and breaks very easy.  I love it!!!,5.0

379,I love this press!  All-in-one with no extra pieces to lose.  And it's stainless so just the simple act of rinsing it off after use removes the garlic smell from your hands.  I did get a little overzealous and pinched my hand between the top and bottom but that only happened once.  I will have this press for a very long time.,5.0
380,"Great garlic press. A bit expensive but well worth it for a durable quality product.  Will even press unpealed garlic and is very easy to clean.  It does require a firm grip, especially for unpealed cloves, so I could not recommend it for those with exceptionally weak hands.",5.0
381,Bought for my GF. She loves it. Has lasted longer than any G-press I have ever owned.,5.0
382,The best garlic press!!!,5.0

384,"After our old garlic press became unusable, I looked for a replacement.  The Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press is what I decided to purchase, and am I ever glad I did!  This press not only is a delight to use with its very uniform pressing of garlic cloves, it is also much easier to clean than our old press.  It is more costly than most other presses, but in my own opinion, it is worth every penny.  If you mince allot of garlic, do yourself a really big favor and get this garlic press.  You won't regret it!",5.0
385,very easy to clean,5.0
386,"I have gone through at least 5 garlic presses over the past 15 years. Each has either broken outright or failed to press very well at all. This press is GREAT! I recommend this garlic press to anyone that ever presses garlic, it really works and is easy to clean. I could have bought 3 with all the money I wasted on the others.",5.0
387,Exactly as the reviews described and very easy to use and clean.  My only suggestion would be to use a more easily removable glue on the stickers.  There was a very gooey sticker on the press and on the handle.,5.0
388,"This was an upgrade from the cheap-o metal garlic presses we had cluttering our drawer before.  Unlike many other reviewers, I only have those crummy presses (not others similarly priced to the Kuhn) to compare with.  That said, we're very happy with it, and have been for the last five years.  It's still in great shape, and we use it several times a week.  We just bought one for a gift for someone else, prompting this review.",5.0
389,but kind of hard to clean even in the DW,4.0
390,My wife has been on the hunt for the perfect garlic press. One that is easy to use and easy to clean. This was the one I found for her after searching through reviews. She loves it. The press is easy to use and not that hard to squeeze. The press is also very easy to clean compared to other models we've tried. Love the design and look. Well worth the price.,5.0
391,This is a beautiful piece of equipment.  The press works effortlessly and clean up was very easy.  The skin and unpressed garlic peeled away.,5.0
392,"The press is very well made and seems to produce more garlic than any other make, using a similar size of clove. Large cloves of garlic are easily accomodated, one at a time. The press is easily cleaned without need to worry about loosing the grate or other components; however, pieces of pulp will get caught up in the pin holding it all together requiring special attention as with the other presses. The only limitation keeping this from a five star rating is the price.",4.0
393,I had previously owned several of the slap-style choppers (several because I kept breaking them). I eventually bit the bullet and got one of these - it's great. I like that I don't have to peel the garlic if I don't want to. Only dinged 1 star because cleaning can be a bit of a pain.,4.0
394,"This is the first and probably only garlic press I will ever purchase. As previously noted it is solidly crafted, and convenient to clean. I do have one suggestion for future buyers/owners- peel your garlic cloves before pressing. It is possible to press unpeeled cloves but the more garlic you press the more difficult it gets to operate. It also begins to squeeze delicious garlicky bits out the sides/top and not through press holes. You will also notice that the garlic builds up over the pressand sticks. I have found that using the dull side of a knife to scrape down ensures i get maximum garlic. Enjoy your press! It is very nice!",4.0
395,"Works great. Total structural, don't think you could break it, but, be careful when pressing, you can get your palm between the handles. Ouch!",5.0
396,"Though expensive, it's worth every penny.  Very sturdy stainless steel that will never bend or discolor.  I'll will it to one of my children!<br /><br />I've had four or five different garlic presses with the Zyliss press my favorite until now.  Pros:  heavy, sturdy stainless steel; pretty good capacity (holds two good-sized cloves); garlic doesn't squish out the sides; fairly easy to clean; extremely easy to press (good for arthritic hands, I think).<br /><br />Cons:  price.",5.0
397,"Very nice garlic press, although if you start to go through more than 5 or 6 garlic it can get a little gunked-up. For more than 5 or 6 garlic bits and pieces start to ooze out of the sides of the press.",4.0
398,"Very satisfied so far!  Works very well, even leaving the garlic unpeeled. I read reviews complaining it was hard to clean. Utter nonsense. Washed out easily in seconds. Skins are easily removed. Might be difficult for someone with tiny hands, but seem very well made, rugged, exactly as advertised.",5.0
399,My mother came over and one of the first things she mentioned was what a grate garlic press that I had. I told her the price and she didn't blink... said that it was night and day over the cheap ones that she used to use. With as much garlic as we go through in our house I couldn't agree more. This was a great purchase and has a durability that I can't imagine wouldn't last for 10+ years,5.0
400,"This is the best press ever. I got it a few months back when it was $10 cheaper, but knowing how great it is, I would pay the extra amount. A solid piece of metal, that is designed to be so easy to clean. Preparing a few tablespoons of garlic is a breeze.",5.0
401,I think this is my last garlic press.  I loved the oxo presses but they break at the hinges after a period of time.  This press is easy to clean & easy to load.  It does allow some garlic to squeeze by the sides of the ram.  I would have given this press a 5 star rating if not for the handles as has been noted.  It takes concentration not to pinch your fingers.,4.0
402,"I've used a few other brands, threw away a few and still have a few in my drawer but this one is the one I keep coming back to, mainly because it's easy to use and clean, I get more from my garlic cloves than my other presses and the consistency is the way I like it.",5.0
403,Great,5.0

406,LOVE this press!  Cleans up so easily and is so much easier to use than the cheaper ones I've had in the past.  Highly recommend it!,5.0
407,I did a lot of research & this one came up.  I got it & love it.<br /><br />It presses more garlic than those other units that leave most of the garlic crushed but not &#34;sent through.&#34;  This waz a refreshing addition to our kitchen gadgets & well worth the extra cost.,5.0
408,"Great product and excellent packaging. This is the 3rd time I had to order this product, because it arrived broken the first two times due to inferior packaging.",5.0
409,So much better than what I've used before. So easy to use. So easy to clean.,5.0
410,This press works!! It really gets that garlic smashed good. I think better than the Susi press I used to have. This press has the right design so that the pressure you put on it is directed on the garlic.,5.0
411,I had garlic press from another company and after a few years of intensive use it broke down. I was looking for a stainless steel garlic press that will last longer and based on the performance reviews I have chosen Kuhn Rikon. I love my new garlic press and it's so easy to clean!,5.0
412,Still going strong MANY YEARS later - the BEST press ever!  You get what you pay for and this item has earned my utter respect.<br />No corrosion - great quality/durability/strength.  Invest in a kitchen item like those your mother and grandmother had for all those many years when things weren't all flimsy pot metal from China!,5.0
413,"Pros: very effective press leaves little residue behind, easy to clean, goes right in the dishwasher<br />Cons: somewhat large and a little ungainly for small hands",4.0
414,"What is there to say, easily and quickly presses garlic and ginger (a huge plus). Cleans quickly, easily, and conveniently. Looks nice, costs too much, but hey this is an extreme example of you get what you pay for. After a bunch of cheap presses not working or breaking I was just so happy to get a quality product.",5.0
415,"Easy to use. Works fantastically well even with unpeeled garlic. Pressure needed is smaller than other garlic presses I used. Garlic comes out very consistent and nice. Cleaning is a breeze as everything comes out, and it comes out perfectly clean from the dishwasher.",5.0
416,"Not much in my life is better than making my wife and daughter happy. Our 20 month old daughter threw away our previous two garlic pressers, but this one is too big and too imposing for her to get her little hands around. Don't let that dissuade you -- it's very easy to press. My wife is petite and absolutely loves it. It's functional, beautiful, very easy to clean and quite a classy thing to have in our kitchen.",5.0

You don't have to peel the garlic to get a great minced product.Uses all the garlic clove. Although you have to open it just as wide as a cheap one takes much less effort to squeeze. All stainless steel and swiss made. If you mince a lot of garlic,this is the one for you. You'll be able to pass this one down to the next generation!",5.0

Usually garlic would squeeze out the sides and I would have to scoop it back into the press, not the case with this press! Put your garlic in and ALL of it goes through the press. You are only left with a little film. After buying one for myself I've been giving them away as gifts. This is the last garlic press you'll ever own. Don't be discouraged by the higher price tag, because it's definitely worth it.",5.0

445,I love this garlic press - especially the fact that you don't have to peel the garlic. It is very easy to use if you don't try to put too many cloves in at a time - I limit it to one large or two medium. It's faster to make multiple small squeezes than it is try and make one big one. I have rather weak hands and have no trouble as long as I don't overload it. Love it!,5.0

I was hesitant to spend $30 on a garlic press, since I had tried others, but I bit the bullet and BOY am I glad I did. This press is simple to use. Just keep  you hand clear as you squeeze down.  Mine got caught once but it just pinched a little. It does a FANTASTIC job mincing garlic and clean up is a breeze with it's easily accessible parts or just throw it in the dishwasher.

The first time I used it I was very pleasantly surprised with the ease in which I crushed many large cloves of garlic. I am also very pleased at how easy it is to clean. It is designed so you can easily remove the garlic skins and membranes before putting it in the dishwasher. The fact that it is stainless steel is another plus. I would highly recommend this tool. It is by far the best garlic press I have ever used.",5.0

It actually works without having to take the skin off of the garlic, a process that I have found to take an inordinate amount of time, whether you hit the garlic with the side of a knife, or use the rubber/plastic cyllinder to roll it off, or just peel it with fingers or knife.  The press is also very easy to clean.  The press feels perfect in my hand, very solid.  I think, given what other products I have tried, that it is the best!",5.0

It is quite heavy, but necessary to crush the garlic.  I've had garlic press handles snap in half because I had to squeeze them.  To clean, you can just rinse under water or use a scotch brite to help get the garlic out of the holes.  I got this as a wedding gift and let my dad try it.  He loved it so much I got him one for father's day.",5.0

I'm sure it'll be the last garlic press I ever have to buy, and I'm okay with that! Kudos to Kuhn Rikon!",5.0

621,"Great, easy to use and easy to clean",5.0
622,"It's costly and that's a concern.  And, although it's the best one used to date, it's not perfect.  Still requires some cleaning attention after use.  Bottom-line, it's sturdy, all-in-one, easy to use, and gets the job done quickly.  If you will use it often enough to justify the expenditure, get it.",4.0
623,Watch out for cheap fakes. I fell for one and it fell apart after only a few uses. The genuine one is great.,4.0
624,"I bought this because America's Test Kitchen said it was the best. It is!!. I bought two more for my kids, they love it. You will too.",5.0

628,It's easy to press and easy to clean. Good product.,5.0
629,I like the design but for optimum leverage the handle needs to be longer. While the design is good for general kitchen use my hands are pretty crippled up and I need a longer lever.,4.0
630,This press is no whip- it crushes garlic well and without mess if not overloaded. I do peel the garlic first and cut off the hard end. I was worried that it might take too much pressure to operate but it is smooth and easy. It is very easy to clean.,4.0
631,"Wow - this really is a teriffic product, worth every penny.  Fits my hand perfectly, feels sturdy, requires little effort to use. The plate with the holes hinges outward for easy cleaning.",5.0

635,Quality item with easy grip. Works way better than the cheaper one I'd been using for years. I like it and would recommend it.,4.0
636,I haven't owned a garlic press for 15 years because they're so hard to use and to clean.  This one has changed my mind.  Just pop the unpeeled cloves into the chamber and squeeze - and you don't have to squeeze very hard - and little bits of garlic shoot out.  It's also extremely easy to clean.  A five-star winner!,99
637,I have gone thru about 3 garlic presses in my life so far and this one will probably last me till I die. It is super heavy duty and works like a charm.  I use a TON of garlic and this works like a charm.,5.0
638,"As is my way, when I used my wifes old garlic press and found the black aluminium tarnish, I knew it was time for a replacement. A quick spot of web research and I came upon a video review by a female American Chef in which the victor was the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press. Try searching under &#34;best garlic press&#34; and the review should be in the list.<br /><br />Anyway, my wife and I have both used this and it is excellent. Functions beautifully, very sturdy and easy to clean. Highly recommended.",5.0
639,This thing is great! You can press garlic without even peeling the cloves.  Folds out so is easy to clean.  I love it.  I want to give it six stars.,5.0

641,An excelleny product. Performed as expected.,5.0
642,"I tried out the press the day I got it and I am extremely satisfied. It's really easy to use and for the most part easy to clean. It looks sleek and is durable (as of now that is, but then again it comes with a life-time warranty). In my opinion, it's worthwhile to get",5.0
643,"Absolutely the best garlic press out there. My wife and I have gone through many garlic presses over the years and this is hands down the most durable, easy to clean and easy to use press out there.  We've had it for several years now and it works just as new. I would highly recommend this product.",5.0
644,Easy to use and clean.,5.0
645,Very good garlic press.,5.0
646,Perfect.,5.0
647,"Does the job well. You will get the most flavour from your garlic as the result is a fine mash. The press is easily cleaned and very sturdy. What else could you want. It was also tested and found to be a winner by America's Test Kitchen (That's why I bought it, and I wasn't disappointed).",5.0
648,"This garlic press is worth every penny.  It is stainless steel so it holds up well.  I had gone through several cheaper presses and finally decided to go for a well made one.  This is very easy to clean, holds up well and is easy to use.  You don't need to press too hard for it to work.  The garlic juice doesn't corrode the press since it is stainless steel, a definite plus.",5.0
649,I love this thing!! Lifetime warranty too. It crushes un-peeled garlic like nobody's business. extremely easy to clean too. Best design ever.,5.0

651,Believe the hype...this presses garlic like it was meant to be pressed.  We were not disappointed at all.  America's Test Kitchen didn't recommend this for nothing.,5.0
652,I got this for my brother for Christmas. My daughter got me one for my birthday and I just love the way it works and how easy it is to clean!,5.0
653,Truly the BEST garlic press out there. Easy to clean. Worth the cost. This will last you 30 years.,5.0
654,"This is a quality piece of engineering: The translation of squeezing force into ultra-fine mincing press works perfectly. In addition to producing extremely fine garlic from unpeeled(!) cloves. Once the clove is through, just flip out the guard and push the remains to the side with a knife (we want to avoid garlic fingers, after all).<br /><br />Oh, and I pressed some fresh ginger today, too. Since that is a bit more stringy than garlic is, you have to be careful how you align the piece in the chamber - with the grain, not against - but once you press, out comes nice and juicy ginger gloop. Perfection.",5.0
655,This is a extraordinary kitchen tool. Its all stainless steel. It will last a lifetime. It crushes garlic even while in its skin. I peel them anyway just to get as much from each clove I can. I have even considered buying 5 more to give to my 5 sisters for Christmas. Would highly recommend this product.,5.0
656,"The best garlic press I have ever used, and a work of art too. It takes much less effort to crush the garlic, due to the multi-lever action. Cleaning is a snap too. Just open it up and run the back of the knife over it in running water, and it comes quite clean. I never have to use a tooth pick to clean out the holes like in other models.  I love to cook, and this tool is the perfect combination of design, form, and function. A+++",5.0
657,It really does press unpeeled garlic and cleans up in a snap ....worth every penny...my great grandchildren will probably be using this...hefty stainless...just buy it...no more garic in the jar.,5.0
658,"Brought this to  friends house to share and compare!  She is a gourmet chef, she immediately ordered one!",5.0

671,"After I used it once, I bought one for everyone in my family. This tool is durable, easy to clean, and above all, makes pressing garlic a piece of cake. It gets a great yield too, because you can press hard, since the device is so easy in hand.",5.0
672,"Very easy to clean, pressing tongue and grate pop outside to get all the bits of garlic off<br />Less waste then any other garlic press I have tried<br />Rated high on ""Things Cooks Love"" list<br />Rated high on ""The Test Kitchen""<br />Would still use a bristle type brush to clean it though",5.0
673,"The ""secret"" to this press is that it's plated with a very high quality surface that is easy to clean, won't discolor your garlic mince, and needs a lower effort to work. Unplated ""raw aluminum"" presses take more effort and discolor your garlic, and the insides get icky. Buy this one and be happy.",5.0

677,"I received this item about 3 weeks ago and have used it almost daily.  U C we love garlic.  This is the best garlic press I have ever seen.  It's actually made of very hefty stainless steel.  After use, it is exceptionally easy to clean due to the way the pressing chamber opens totally up and one can very easily clean out the garlic husks left from the pressing procedure.  There is no wasted garlic with this little jewel.  In addition to the flawless operation and beautifully machined stainless steel parts, the unit is made in Switzerland with wonderful Swiss ingenuity--sort of like a Swiss watch, IT IS NOT MADE IN CHINA out of American beer cans.  This unit is a thing of beauty and wonderful functionality and deserves a special display in the Smithsonian.  Halleluiah for Kuhn Rikon",5.0

682,This is a superior tool. It is the Cadillac of garlic presses. I can't see it ever breaking or rusting. It is heavier than most presses. It is easy to clean. It is fairly easy to squeeze. I do wish it was a bit easier to squeeze but what I truly like is the fact that my hands don't hurt when I use it.,5.0

688,I saw this on America's Test Kitchen. It's as great as advertised. Very easy to clean.,5.0
689,This is a very top notch press. Don't even have to de-skin the cloves. I no longer have to worry about shortening the length of my left thumb from errant knife chops. The tool is very well made. Only thing that bothered me about it is the item is made in China. Other than that it is a good product.,5.0
690,"Love the press, but should it break after 7 weeks?  Now I am outside the return window.",4.0

696,"I am most impressed with this press. It outperformed the others that I had but barely used. I find it better to press my garlic rather then chopping it.

708,"I love how well this thing is designed. It looks great, works great and is easy to clean which I think is the biggest difficulty with garlic pressers. Just be sure to clean it under the tap shortly after pressing in order to clean easily. And you will want to quickly pop out the membrane left by each piece of garlic before pressing the next one.",5.0
709,Rather on the heavy side but does the job. It takes a very firm grip if you fill it up.,4.0
710,It's a good one.  I especially like that its stainless steel,5.0
711,"Very easy to use and clean. I've been using mostly for mincing garlic lately. I just squeeze and take chef knife and cut across where the garlic comes out. Does an excellent job all around and so far I'd have to say will probably last a lifetime.  The cost is a bit more than you might pay for other consumer type garlic presses, but the extra cost is worth every penny and this is a commercial piece of equipment.",5.0

It minces all of the garlic clove and the interlocking pieces of the garlic press lift up so that its clean up is so easy!! No more bits of garlic stuck in crevices that you can't clean.

FYI, I have found that the garlic I press with the Kuhn (compared to my old flimsy press or freshly minced garlic) has a much more assertive flavor - noticeably stronger.

Here's a summary of my experience so far:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Attractive ergonomic design<br />- Tough, no danger of this falling apart<br />- Gets the job done. Simplicity to crush garlic. Which is the point, right?<br />- Very easy to clean. Perhaps the best feature. The grill opens out making it trivial to clean completely.<br />- All stainless steel.<br />- Real reviews. If you see a competing product with a bizarre number of 5-star reviews be paranoid. As the leading brand the Kuhn Rikon has enough real reviews that you can trust them.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It is possible to pinch yourself when closing it. As long as you're aware of this, it's unlikely it could happen to you, so I won't take a star away for this.<br /><br />Conclusion: It's a very functional kitchen utensil with a timeless design, and I would buy it again, and recommend it to anyone.",5.0

But, the product is as good as all the reviews I read, very happy. HOWEVER.....it had a stuck-on label on the handle that was almost impossible to remove. I am one of those people who hates having stuck-on labels on anything. So, before I could even use this beauty I tried to remove the label stuck to the handle. I pulled off as much as I could, then soaked in hot water and soap. The paper part came off ok, then there was an entire layer of glue that would not soak off. I tried some olive oil, which usually works, nada. So actually had to scrape it off, and in the process scratched this beauty all to hell. It is now not so beautiful, which irks me. As a chef,I love well-made, beautiful tools. I am very angry right now. I only received the package an hour ago. Don't try to suggest that ""goo-gone"" remover, as the reason I needed a garlic press at all is because my husband has been diagnosed with cancer and he is on a therapy that requires LOTS of garlic every day. We are not allowed to use ANY petroleum based products, as this industry is what contributed to his acquiring this disease. Sorry, folks, ZERO STARS for labeling!",5.0

1081,"Since I own both this Kuhn Rikon and the Rosle garlic presses, I have posted this comparison on the Rosle reviews, as well:<br /><br />There's no doubt that the Rosle is extremely good--in fact, I would have given it five stars just a few weeks ago. But then I purchased the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press (#2315), after reading a recent review of it in Cook's Illustrated. After repeatedly comparing the two side-by-side, the Kuhn is unquestionably the better press. It was also about $8 cheaper here on Amazon, but that doesn't seem to be the case any longer--in any event, I didn't consider price for this review.<br /><br />What's strange is that the crushing mechanisms on both presses appear to be identical. In fact, prior to crushing with the Kuhn, I felt disappointed when I received it, convinced that I had just bought the same garlic press twice. However, for whatever reason (and it remains a mystery to me), the Kuhn's crushing of garlic is clearly superior in two ways: 1) It produces a more beautifully consistent mince of the garlic, whereas the result from the Rosle seems more ""smashed"" by comparison. The difference isn't subtle--I was honestly shocked by it. 2) The pressing is more complete, with less left behind in the hopper, and it presses unpeeled garlic better, as well. (That said, I get a much better press from either unit with peeled cloves.)<br /><br />Ergonomically, the shape of the Kuhn also handles better, although I never had a problem with the Rosle. And I'd say both units have stainless steel construction of equally high quality. For me, it was the crushing performance and not the handling that has sadly relegated my Rosle to the drawer, since I now always reach first for the Kuhn.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/11: After four years of regular use, this press continues to perform like new, so I can now add a 5 star recommendation for long-term durability, too. Unless this Kuhn Rikon somehow finds its way under a steamroller, I suspect it's the last garlic press that I'll ever have to buy. I'm baffled by the occasional complaint here that this press is hard to clean as it could hardly be any easier. Besides the handles, there are only two other parts to this unit: the mesh steel hopper through which the clove is pressed and the steel ""presser"" itself. As can be seen in one of the customer photos posted, both of those parts swing out (easily) from the handles, allowing you to simply rinse them clean under the faucet.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/13: I've noticed a few recent comments to this review that criticize the supposed small capacity of this press, with one person stating that it doesn't even fit one large clove. Well, that may be true if you're trying to press elephant garlic, or harvesting your garlic on the grounds of a nuclear site. For the record, the hopper measures 1.5 inches long X .75 inches wide X 1 inch deep. This is also the identical size of the hopper in the Rosle garlc press. I have never encountered a clove it couldn't handle, and I usually press more than one at a time.<br /><br />Best-selling author Tim Ferriss, who wrote last year's amazing The Four Hour Chef, had this to say about the Kuhn: "" I've always hated dealing with garlic until I found the Kuhn Rikon Epicurion Garlic Press. It's expensive as s*** and it's amazing. You don't have to peel the garlic and it's the easiest thing in the world to clean.""",5.0

Leave the peel on and press multiple cloves at once.  Don't be mislead if you leave the skin on, you have to clean between pressings or the holes get clogged.  Lot of money, but very sturdy construction.  Will last a long time.  Also, cleans in seconds.  hopper folds out and opens up so it rinses clean very easily.<br />My last garlic press was seldom used, took too long to clean, took multiple presses as garlic oozed out around the plunger.  It was such a pain, I chose to smash and mince with a chef's knife (tedious and leaves you fingers smelling like raw garlic), rather than wrestle with that thing. This press gets practically all of the goods in the dish you are preparing, just papery skin remains.",5.0
1108,This is the best garlic press I have ever used. So easy to squeeze the handle  to press the garlic through. The inside lefts out to easily clean the press.

1114,"in that time I've had the chance to test it properly. I bought this on recommendation from Cook's Illustrated.<br /><br />The press came packaged in a large envelope lined with bubblewrap. There was no extra padding besides this and the press was perfectly smooth. It's heavy and made completely of metal so it's pretty resistant. I've dropped it a few times and its gotten some scratches but no dents. I'm having a really difficult time imagining this heavy, completely metallic object falling apart with normal use. You'd probably have to run it over with your car to get some dents. Even then I think it would still work!<br /><br />The hopper where the garlic goes is not huge. You won't be able to crush whole elephant garlic cloves. At most a very large regular garlic clove. But the best use for these kinds of presses is to quickly process a bunch of those tiny cloves you sometimes get and are incredibly annoying to peel. The garlic comes out in regular pieces, but if you press a huge clove, some of the clove will squeeze between the side of the hopper the side instead. Very little of the flesh is left behind in the press along with the skin. I've also tried pressing peeled garlic to see which comes out better, and I'm happy to say it works best with the skin on.<br /><br />Also, I won't lie, you will have to press hard in the beginning but it'll get easier with time. Sometimes you may also pinch yourself with the handle if your hands are wet. You can overcome this by pressing slowly to make sure your flesh isn't getting caught. This is not common, though, and can easily be avoided.<br /><br />Another use for this press is to mince small quantities of ginger and vegetables like carrots. You first have to cut them into 1/4 inch pieces. They will come out lightly crushed which is nice if you dont want them to be crunchy like they would be if you minced them with a knife.<br /><br />I don't know if this garlic press previously came with a brush or another accessory to clean the hopper. I bought mine directly from Amazon and I didn't get one. Its not necessary, regardless.<br /><br />Overall this is a great garlic press for everyday use. Its also very attractive, is not flimsy, nor will you ever feel like you might break it while you're using it. A few flaws means I can't give it five stars, but i would definitely repurchase this press and recommend it without hesitation.",4.0
1115,"I spent years trying to find a good garlic press.  I wanted one that was capable of pressing garlic with the skin still left on the separate clove.  I've tried many different styles and never found one that worked the way I wanted it to.<br /><br />That is, until I found this garlic press by Kuhn Rikon.  It is so easy to use and to clean.  I've had mine for close to five years and have never had a problem with it.  I liked it so well, that I purchased several as gifts for family and friends.  Universally, we have agreed that it is the best and the last press we will need.",5.0
1116,"I'm going to have concur with the other one-star reviews. I always got more waste left behind than minced garlic that came through. But the worst was that after just five months of use, the pins on the hinge came out while it was in the sink (so I certainly wasn't overstressing it) and now it's useless. For such an expensive gadget, I certainly expect better. I've contacted the manufacturer about replacement.<br /><br />&lt;strong>Update 3/30/2017&lt;strong>: I contacted the manufacturer Kuhn Rikon about a warranty replacement and they said that garlic presses sold under their name for less than $40 are most likely Chinese knockoffs (which mine was), but they were willing to cover it under warranty anyway. And they sent a replacement via USPS express mail, costing them $7.20 in addition to the cost of the replacement press. Good for them for standing by their product so solidly. Looking at the new one and the broken one side by side, the knockoff is nearly identical, but there are a couple of subtle differences including the closer fit of the grate that the clove gets pushed through.",99
1117,"Pros<br />Almost-perfect solid construction and materials<br />Super easy cleaning with no special tools required<br /><br />Cons<br />Pinches palm at full press<br /><br />Now a bit of supplemental explanation about the pros and cons....<br />Pro<br />What i thought was a design flaw about the design may well have been a clever part of the design--the 1mm space between the two pressing surfaces at full press leaves a thin film of garlic material. Initially i thought its wasteful and thus could be a defect but after a few uses, i realized having a thin film residue actually makes cleaning easier because peeling this film lifts away with it the garlic remnants that are still lodged in the little press holes. Thus, this makes it unnecssary to use a brush or any other special tool to clean like other presses.<br /><br />Con<br />Only one, thats right.  At full press, the two handles join together completely similar to an animal bite, thus, it tends to pinch the palm of your  hand....not overly painful but annoying. (See attached fotos).  If the two handles left 0.5-1&#34; of space in between at full press, then that would have avoided this problem.  I would have given it 5 stars then.",4.0
1118,"I got this to replace my older Oxo garlic press, which had started to let water leak into the rubber handle every time it was washed. I purchased it based on the good review that Cook’s Illustrated had given it, and I couldn't be happier with my choice.<br /><br />This garlic press is all stainless steel, and there are no places for water to get trapped when washed in the dishwasher. Despite not having rubber handles, its rounded shape fits well in the hand and is very comfortable to hold. The 4-bar linkage mechanism makes it much easier to press than most garlic presses, and the hopper can easily hold a large clove or two smaller cloves. The pop-out grid design makes it very easy to clean since the skins just slide out and don't get trapped, so I don’t find myself having to wash it in the dishwasher to get it clean.<br /><br />I use a lot of garlic, so this press gets heavy use, and I haven’t had any rusting, pitting, or other corrosion, and it never has a lingering garlic smell after being washed.<br /><br />This is a great garlic press, and I’d highly recommend it for anyone looking to upgrade.",5.0
1119,"I read about this particular garlic press in Cook's Illustrated.  I have found the magazine quite reliable when they recommend kitchen tools.  Like another reviewer, I thought the design looked extremely similar to what I already had.  Since my current garlic press was not very good (it mainly expelled juice more than garlic) I was a bit apprehensive, but our local organic farm was including a lot of garlic in our weekly produce box so I decided to go for it.  Am I ever glad I did.  I really like this garlic press -- it performs very well.  When I squeeze, nice ""minced"" garlic emerges from the press.  I am very happy with this product and recommend it without reservation.",5.0
1120,"Believe it or not I did a lot of research before buying a garlic press. This was an important purchase for me and the price ranges and the quality of the presses varied so yes I research it. I spent way too much time at bed bath and beyond reading packages, comparing prices, staring at and touching garlic presses. I read comments and watched videos. I came across a video in which a chef compared garlic presses. She tried out five or six garlic presses and decided, claimed that this Kuhn Rikon was the best. Definitely not the cheapest option but I figured I'm gonna get the best garlic press and have it forever. I didn't want a garlic press with any plastic or rubber and this press is definitely a sturdy piece of stainless steel. Its my first and only garlic press so I have nothing to compare it to but it works like a lucky charm. If you don't get all the skin off your garlic clove this press says, &#34;don't worry I got it.&#34; And it does. No garlic is left behind either. I don't put it in the dishwasher. I scrape out the skin and hand wash it in soapy water, dry it and tuck it away in the gadget drawer. I'm over the price. It's one of the best gadgets in my kitchen.",5.0
1121,"Great garlic press. It works like nothing else. I bought a garlic press with a removal basket and it had the hardest time pressing the garlic cloves. This was a breeze. I tried it with the skin on and it was a tad bit harder to squeeze. I actually preferred peeling my garlic because I seemed to get more garlic. When I left the peel on, some of the garlic was stuck to the peel. I guess that would do if you were in a hurry. But I think it would be a waste of garlic. It was super easy to clean. Just rinse well under running water, make sure to flip it around so that all sides of the press are rinsed well. Just open the the handles all the way and the basket will swing down for easier cleaning. I suggest cleaning right away because garlic sticks when it dries. I love this garlic press. I will buy as a housewarming gift if the need were to arise. It is that awesome.",5.0
1122,"You have to be crazy, a kitchen utensil snob, or both to be spending near $35 for a garlic press. I looked at a ton of reviews, asking myself if I had lost my mind to be spending so much on one product. It's been 1 year or so since I've had this product and seriously, BEST INVESTMENT I'VE MADE in my kitchen utensil collection.<br /><br />I was a true snob with wanting to chop and mince my garlic with a knife. I thought, &#34;Garlic Press' are for amateurs.&#34; I got over myself. This stuff is heaven scent. If you use a lot of garlic, chopping becomes tiring after a while, so I bust out this garlic press, stick a whole clove of garlic (without peeling it) and bam! I got finely chopped garlic in my food.<br /><br />PROS:  No need to peel your garlic.  It can fit 2 small cloves, but one large clove. Easy clean up. I can throw it in the dishwasher, and after even one year, it looks brand new with no scratches.<br /><br />CONS: The press minces garlic in a very very fine manner. If you want slightly larger or &#34;normal&#34; minced garlic pieces that you can get when using a knife, this press can't produce the same. So, you'll get a somewhat watery, almost mushed minced garlic.<br /><br />Forget buying the cheap ones that cost $8. This stuff hasn't rusted after numerous washes in the dishwasher. It's sleek, modern, and also easy cleanup. I'm glad I skipped to one of the most highly rated garlic presses. Now that I think about it, $35 really isn't that bad at all for what I got.",5.0

We're also happy with our other Kuhn Rikon equipment (pressure cooker).

1124,"I have two Kuhn Rikon's presses.  A plastic one, with a built-in scraper&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kuhn-Rikon-Easy-Clean-Garlic-Press-w-scraper-White/dp/B0000CEWRW"">Kuhn Rikon Easy-Clean Garlic Press w/scraper, White</a>&nbsp;and Kuhn's Epicurean. There are good and bad things about both.<br /><br />1. The Epicurean comes with a lifetime warranty.  The Easy-Clean comes with a 1 yr warranty.  I broke my Easy-Clean after about 8 months and without any documentation, and Kuhn Rikon replaced it in 6 weeks. You can get 3 Easy-Cleans for the price of one Epicurean. I broke mine while trying to press multiple cloves at the same time, maybe 3.<br /><br />2. Both are dishwasher safe, have a fold-out press plate that allows you to clean it easily. The Easy-Clean has a built-in scraper bar so you don't need to have a handy edge to scrape the extruded garlic off of the press plate. You need two hands to do this, one for the handles and one for the scraper bar, but you need two hands if you need to use a knife to scrape the garlic off the Epicurean, too.<br /><br />3. Both make pretty good minced garlic, the Easy-Clean, imo, seems to make slightly coarser pieces. Both leak juice on the sides of the press. Both collect bits of garlic on top of the press plate or in the fold mechanism.<br /><br />4. It is slightly easier to press the Epicurean, though a friend of mine with slight palsy found the Epicurean hard to handle and press partly due, I think to the weight of the device and the excessive curve and the spread of the handles when it has garlic in the chamber. The Easy-Clean is easier to grasp since the handles lay closer and have no curve. Someone with small hands may find the Epicurean hard to use one handed.<br /><br />5. Excessive juicing of the garlic happens when large cloves or multiple cloves are used in either press. This means that you can have some stray squirts of garlic juice and garlic if you are pressing into a small bowl (like those little bowls used to mise en place on cooking shows).<br /><br />5. I like the size of the resulting garlic pieces; a very fine mince. I wish they had a way of giving you a slightly larger size with some sort of changeable press plate. You can certainly prepare your garlic in the press, and just squeeze it into the pan when needed. If you are looking to retard the browning/burning effect, a nice trick is to press it into a small bowl and add a bit of water prior to putting it into the pan, the garlic will be so moist that it will not burn in many circumstances giving you more time to saute or be more forgiving of a hotter pan.<br /><br />6. The Epicurean can juice ginger - it is constructed so well. If the ginger root is very young, and tender, you will get particles, if it tougher, you will be able to squeeze out the juice and leave all the fiber on the press plate. Obviously not for 1"" pieces of ginger but a modest coin slice can be used.

In Asian cooking, particles trump juice. Hence my wish for slightly larger holes.<br /><br />7. Garlic being what it is in most stores, susceptible to fungus and mold on the paper skins (even if you can't see it), I never use unpeeled garlic, and always cut off the root end. (And I take out any green shoot in the middle since it's bitter.) My opinion. I can't talk about pressing unpeeled garlic.<br /><br />8. I really like the Epicurean but I also really like the built-in scraper bar on the Easy-Clean. And between my two presses, I think that the Easy-Clean's pressed garlic seems more like little pieces while the Epicurian's results are finer.",4.0
1125,"The best garlic press I've ever used.  Crushes even large cloves (unpeeled--I don't see why anyone would peel a clove before using a press, but whatever...) easily.  I just got it and used it last night and was delighted with the small amount of hand strength needed to press a large clove (it can handle a good-sized clove).  The flesh of the clove comes out completely and cleanly with a relatively light squeeze.  With my old Zyliss it was a struggle to press large cloves.  You practically sprained your hand.  The promotional text of this press advertises this squeezing efficiency and it is 100% correct.  The second big advantage of this press is ease of cleaning.  With the ingenious design, the piece with the holes (that the garlic comes out through) swings out for complete ease of cleaning.  No more digging down to clear off the pesky remains of a clove.  And it's all one piece--no separate part.  It's beautifully made of stainless steel, so no more &#34;mystery metal&#34; when you're scraping the pressed garlic off the face.  I've looked for a press this good for years, both in kitchen stores and online, including one of the most popular models here on Amazon, and had just about given up on finding one this good.  A great garlic press!",5.0
1126,"In short, this garlic press is beautifully designed, easy to use and clean, and it fits perfectly in the hand. However, the first time I purchased this item, I unknowingly received a counterfeit from DUNG PHAMSDDA. When that garlic press broke after 7 months of use (see photo), I contacted Kuhn Rikon and they kindly shipped me a new one. Khun Rikon's customer service was amazing and they honored their 2 year warranty even though my garlic press was a counterfeit. If you are thinking about purchasing one, make sure you purchase from Amazon directly and not from any Amazon verified third party sellers. I am fairly confident that most of the negative reviews are from the recipient of counterfeit copies. This garlic press has the biggest hopper of any garlic press I've used, the squeezing mechanism takes advantage of geometry so that the least amount of force from your hands translates to the greatest amount of pressure on the garlic, and it even presses unpeeled garlic. I have recommended this item to many friends and everyone reported back with raving reviews. Definitely make the leap of faith, purchase it from Amazon directly, and enjoy your new favorite kitchen gadget.",5.0
1127,"While I do sometimes use a large knife to crush and coarsely chop garlic cloves, I find the small uniform pieces from a garlic press are more ideal for certain dishes. I had a press that I'd been using for years until the hinge finally popped on it. Certainly, garlic presses can easily be found for $10-12; but I decided to do a bit of research to find one that would work well, clean easily, and be long lasting.<br /><br />Besides the many glowing reviews on Amazon, I found that Cook's Illustrated highly endorsed this Kuhn Rikon Epicurean press. Also, the folks at America's Test Kitchens did an in-depth, hands-on comparison of various brands of garlic presses. After evaluating the presses for many variables such as precision, ease-of-use, cleaning, and durability, this Kuhn Rikon model was their top-rated.

It's solidly constructed of stainless steel and feels comfortable and nicely heavy in my hand with a hinge system that works smoothly. It opens up easily with a hopper that flips out for even easier cleaning than most presses. It works with unpeeled as well as peeled; but I usually tend to peel my garlic cloves first to ensure that no pieces of papery garlic peel go into recipes. While I usually grate ginger root, I've found that this press works perfectly fine for crushing and mincing small pieces of ginger root, too.<br /><br />The Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press is definitely a top-of-the-line product.  The only reason I'm giving it a 4 or 4.5 rating rather than 5 stars is mainly because I'd expected it to have a MUCH easier squeeze than its competitors. It's marketed as such with references made to its unusual lever-action which is supposed to be far superior to the one-to-one action of most garlic presses. It is an easier squeeze; but, truthfully, I didn't notice that huge of a difference over my former $14 one.<br /><br />Still, it is a very nice press which I expect to use for many years",4.0
1128,"Upfront:  I didn't buy this through Amazon, so this is strictly a review of the product.<br />This is a big, heavy duty, easy to clean, garlic press.<br /><br />You don't have to peel the garlic to get a good result because this is a very heavy duty gadget, crushes right through, skin and all..  You do lose a certain amount of garlic this way, but I bag and freeze the leftover peels to include in a cheesecloth bag when I'm making soups or broths -- a fair amount of flavor and no guilt about waste.  ;)  However, there's nothing stopping you from peeling your garlic, if you're less lazy than I.<br /><br />To clean, you just pull the two handles as far apart as they will go, and the grid basket swings out for complete access.  How simple is that?<br /><br />I didn't give this five stars because its size and heavy duty aspect are also drawbacks if you have small/weak hands or arthritis.  It really takes a very strong grip to press the garlic with the skin on, less so if it's peeled.  But this is a sizeable tool, and it's going to be hard going for a lot of people.  I don't have especially small hands or arthritis, but I still find I have to use both hands to get it to close/press if the garlic clove is at all on the large size.<br /><br />So, excellent product, but it takes a certain amount of strength to use.",4.0
1129,"I had an ancient press that squished out garlic around the flat piece that pushes on the garlic, and what came out through the holes was some mashed up garlic, so I put &#34;really good garlic press&#34; on my Christmas list.  The Kuhn Rikon is exactly that - a really good garlic press.  It had back-squish, and what came out the business end was not a mash, but very fine bits of garlic that were totally perfect.  My old press was a one-clove-at-a-time press, so that's what I did with this one.  I don't know how it would work with a hopper full of cloves, but I'll happily press one at a time if my results are this good.  I didn't clean it out between cloves, which I had to do with my old press, and the Kuhn Ridon still didn't have back-squish even after several cloves.  It was easy to clean, too.",5.0
1130,"The garlic press itself works well. However, the handle has a major design flaw. The first time my love used the garlic press, he injured himself pretty bad (bleeding/skin broken). When you clamp down (to press the garlic) his skin got pinched between the two handles. I think Kuhn Rikon needs to take a look at the handles and redesign them to prevent people from injuring themselves. Aside from said flaw, the press crushes garlic well and it is fairly easy to wash. The stainless steel used is of good quality. Due to the possibility of the above injury, I would not buy this product again and actually wish I could just return it.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've had this product for over a year now and I would never go back to another garlic press. After getting to know the handle better, I no longer worry about injuring myself (nor have I). I like that the handle is sturdy and and press is very easy to clean.",5.0

I finally got around to using it and am very impressed by it.<br /><br />For my use, I broke up a head of garlic, cut the 'root' ends off the cloves before putting them in the crushing compartment. The compartment fits one large clove or several smaller cloves with the same performance. Not much pressure is required to crush the garlic, which fantastic for someone that frequently has sore hands/fingers. The garlic leaves the device nice and crushed-- easy to remove with the edge of a knife.<br /><br />I felt best performance required cleaning the crushing compartment after each clove. Initially, I was displeased at the difficulty of cleaning out the garlic peels. I soon realized that the 'compartment' has no sides. Simply lift the grate up and wipe the peels out.

Will buy a few more as gifts.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Still working great, this should the last garlic press you will ever need to buy. Perhaps, make the following improvement, make the basket bigger; to fit more garlic. But that is no big deal to me, nick picking.<br /><br />Also for those that are looking for an economical garlic press, take a look at Ikea's ""365+ V&Auml;RDEFULL garlic press""; if you have an Ikea store near you.

I was happy enough with the Zyliss (especially the plastic cleaning tool), but by the end of the second year, its finish started flaking off, and the pins on the cleaning tool starting bending too easily. I couldn't be more pleased with the Kuhn Rikon; I've had it for two years now, and it looks and performs like the day I acquired it. I love its hefty design, although I can appreciate that smaller hands might find it a little too large. I read Doctorsirena's review wherein she stated that the KR left a flat piece of garlic after pressing. That's true, but as she also mentioned, her Zyliss did the same thing. I've never had a press that doesn't. Personally, with a whole head of garlic costing not more than a few dimes, I don't find the ""leftovers"" an issue. I do agree with Doctorsirena's claim that some garlic oozes out the sides, but I think that, again, it's just part of the residue one gets with any press. My opinion on ease of cleaning?

I would have to somewhat carefully orient the clove in such a way that the press would properly enter the chamber and push the garlic through the holes. I would then have to carefully decompress the press, so that not too much unpressed garlic escaped and fell into the bowl. I would then carefully gather up the unpressed garlic, and fold it back into the chamber for another pass.<br /><br />I thought that this was just the way that garlic presses worked.<br /><br />I'm not sure what it was exactly that prompted me to get this Khun Rikon garlic press. It was on a bit of a whim, I think. What an eye opening experience though! The depth of the chamber, the angle of movement of the press... they are all perfect. There is no more negotiating with the placement of the clove... I can just throw it in haphazardly, and it works, every time. Leftover unpressed pieces of garlic just fall back into place for a reshoot, or if somehow they have snuck around to the other side of the plate, the are contained within the unit, and don't fall, unpressed, into the bowl.<br /><br />After having used this garlic press, I wonder why so many others are so poorly designed.

Now I know why it's worth it.<br /><br />It minces like that, it cleans like that (just rinse, garlic's a natural anti-microbial), it makes you want to eat more garlic, make garlic bread every night, make garlic butter, make garlic oil, stir fry garlic add some cilantro right at the end just to wilt, and put it on fish, meat, chicken, pork, veggies, even cereal. I've never had such fresh breathe.<br /><br />It does a great job on ginger, all the tough fibers are left on the press, add that to your stir fry.<br /><br />This thing looks built to last, my rivets are solid, there's no stamping, things got welded together it seems.

Judging on the quality, I imagine that this garlic press will last for years and I will probably save money in the long run.  I see that today they are 4 for 3.  This is a great deal!  Do it.  And share the love.<br /><br />Update 10/31/15:  6 years later still as good as new after hundreds, maybe thousands,  of cloves. Worth every penny!!",5.0
1142,"I evaluated this Press and the K.R. Easy-Squeeze before making my purchase. Although I ended up choosing the Easy Squeeze (a little short on cash that week), it wasn't an 'easy' decision because I really liked the Epicurean.<br /><br />The Epicurean is absolutely beautiful in person- much better than it looks online. I admired that (I'm in the design industry) as well as the 'heft' of the product (feels like when you hold a very well balanced Chef's knife in your hands).<br /><br />I am very happy with the Easy Squeeze, but if/when anything happens to it, the Epicurean is my replacement.<br /><br />Also, I believe that the Epicurean would make a great gift for those who are serious cooks or those that appreciate great industrial design (or design in general). And if a person likes both cooling and design, it's a sure hit!<br /><br />PS - the mechanism to press the garlic appears to be the same one used in the K.R. Easy Squeeze Press, and so I can say (after using it several times a week for the last 2 months) that it is very easy to clean and TOTALLY presses out a huge amount of garlic (where does it all come from?!)<br /><br />Enjoy.",5.0
1143,"I researched all kinds of garlic presses before buying this one, then promised myself I would review it. We've had it for 18 months, and here I am finally! This press is just perfect.<br />1. Very easy to clean - unlike most other presses, the part with holes flips out and you can just flick off the layer of skin. Also goes in the dishwasher, and doesn't get all scraped up like my other one did.<br />2. You can put 2 large garlic cloves in, unpeeled, at a time. I don't often need to press more than 2, so that works just fine for me. And if I do use more than 2, I don't necessarily have to clean it out before doing the next batch. But like I said above, it takes about 3 seconds to clean out so I usually do that between pressings.<br />3. It presses very evenly. I'm not an excellent cook so I don't know how much this matters to me, but I do notice that the garlic browns more evenly with this press.<br />4. Easy to squeeze. I was a little worried because some reviewers said they had a hard time squeezing it together. I'm a small woman who has a hard time opening new jars, and I have no problem squeezing this one. I usually need to use two hands, but I've had to do that with other presses too.<br />5 stars! It's awesome. Worth the money. Oh, and it's recommended by America's Test Kitchen. :)",5.0
1144,"When my husband recently broke our IKEA garlic press which I've had probably for close to 10 years, I decided to look for something that was a bit more heavy-duty.

1146,"I've been managing with a couple of aluminum garlic presses that I've had for years, but they hurt my hands, and they require so much pressure that I have to cut the medium and big cloves up into halves or thirds, or I can't press them at all. One press in particular allows unpressed garlic to work its way out around the edges. And sometimes I wonder how much aluminum ends up in my food, especially when I have to poke and scrape with a knife. It was time for a good stainless steel press.<br /><br />This little gem is definitely better than any garlic press I've ever used! I am now able to press a good-sized clove all at once. None of the garlic escapes around the edges of the plunger, the pressed garlic is nicely minced, and very little remains in the hopper. The screen part flips out for easy cleaning---no need to poke at the holes with a knife tip, or dig out the bits from between the ""fingers"" on a cleaner mechanism (like with my others).<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's still a bit of a stretch to get the pressing started (my hands are on the small side, and using both hands simultaneously works best). But the well-designed handles don't hurt, and the pressing is definitely easier than with the others.<br /><br />Considering that most garlic presses cost $12 to $15 and don't work nearly as well, it's worth it to get this one instead.",4.0

And, if it matters to you, it is a really lovely design.  HIGHLY recommended!",5.0

I have really bad arthritis with joint replacements in my hands so I need to use both hands with this tool but the curved handle makes that seem almost intuitive. I love that I can save a step and not peel the garlic. The swing out pressing plate makes it soooo much easier to clean than presses I've owned in the past.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive but in all these years I've never regretted this purchase and I expect this tool will last a lifetime. Highly recommended.",4.0

I can't recall if this was gifted to us, or if we ended up purchasing it (oops), but this is the BEST, the BEST garlic press that I have used.<br /><br />I love how sturdy the handles are and I can shove in 2-3 cloves at a time (depending on size) and because of the study handles, pressing is easy.<br /><br />But I think the best bonus about this awesome garlic press is how easy it is to clean it. There is no fuss to cleaning, and no itty-bitty garlic remnant that sticks around. LOVE it.<br /><br />And after 3 years of use, it's still in mint-condition.",5.0
1150,"I purchased this Kuhn Rikon garlic press several years ago from my local Le Gourmet Chef outlet store. My inlaws thought I was nuts for paying $50+ for this garlic press. I was sick and tired of going through cheap garlic presses having them break and fall apart so I finally bit the bullet and purchased this one. It is by far worth every penny I spent on it! I love it! It is a nice, solid, heavy garlic press. You won't be disappointed in the least. I highly recommend it. If you're unsure about spending this much on a garlic press let me be the first to tell you that it really will last years! I use mine regularly and it is still as perfect as the day I purchased it. To wash it I pop it in the top rack of my dishwasher (put the handles in the open position so that the entire thing gets washed). Another plus to this press is that the piece of metal where the clove touches & presses through flips up so that you just wipe off the leftover clove (unlike other presses where you have to dig out the leftover clove). I HIGHLY recoomend this press & would rate it higher stars if I could.",5.0
1151,"After testing this bad boy out in my mother's kitchen, I knew I needed one. I had been putting off buying a garlic press, as I didn't want to buy a press and have it break or have problems with it within a year. For some reason, garlic presses in particular seem to be a challenge of design.<br /><br />After mincing or grating my garlic by hand, this press is a revelation. I use it almost daily and it handles wear well so far (I've had it for a year). I don't know if this is the only garlic press I'll ever own, but I don't see why it wouldn't be. I'm sure in 15 years this press will still be around my kitchen and working like a charm. It's high-quality and will last for so long, it's definitely worth the investment.",5.0
1152,Love it! This garlic press is easy to use. It has a large capacity so it fits even those big cloves of garlic. It minces the garlic in only one press even with the peel still on. Clean up is a breeze with the flip up basket. It is nice looking as well and very sturdy. It make me feel bad for all the garlic I wasted over the last few years with my old less useful press.,4.0
1153,"This press looks and acts the part. Solid construction ensures longevity and reliability. The press is tough enough to take on other harder roots like ginger as well. Pressing garlic is a cinch with this but although pressing ginger requires a bit more effort, this press handles it quite well too.<br /><br />The pressing surface is fully openable to enable quick and easy cleaning. The all steel construction makes for faster cleaning compared to some of its competitors which have plastic parts.<br /><br />The large and curved grip makes it comfortable on the hands, and allows more surface area of your palm to be in contact to spread out the pressure.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars if not for the price, which I think is a bit on the high side, but I guess you do get what you pay for. Highly recommended.",4.0

A since garlic does have natural sugars, being able to put in the dishwasher is great.<br /><br />I think I can stop looking...I have found  THE garlic press.",5.0
1157,"Okay, before I selected this garlic press for my b-day gift I read all the reviews.<br /><br />1) Complaint about no instructions- If you need instructions to operate a garlic press you probably should put it back down and walk away from the kitchen.  Garlic presses are self explanatory and like all garlic presses you put the garlic in between the part w/ the holes and the flat surface that closes to ""press"" said holes.<br /><br />2) small hands-  This press works great with my small hands and my 4 year old son can almost work it w/out any difficulty.  So, it is easy enough for a 4 yr old to use.<br /><br />I love my new press.  I have yet to verify it presses ginger but I will know in a couple of days.  If there are any problems I will let you know.  Just please don't put too much worry in those 2 complaints I have addressed above.",5.0

1159,I've had this press for at a year now and there is really nothing negative to say about this item.  It does the job very well and cleanup is so much easier than the conventional garlic presses.  I've broken a few with too many or too large of a clove but this one is far superior.  I can press more garlic without spending too much time trying to pull off the garlic skin.  Cleanup is easier and simpler because of the design.  It's a bit expensive but overall it will last longer and it is very convenient to use.  Thumbs up!,5.0

Fresh garlic is so much better than the stuff from the jar, and now I put garlic in everything. I have larger hands so it is very easy for me to press the handles together. I bought this press for my mother for mother's day to test it out before I bought mine. She has smaller hands and said that it was a little harder for her to press the handles together but she was very pleased with the results and ease of cleaning it. It is very easy to clean because the inner pieces swing out. I highly recommend this press.",5.0

1167,"I enjoy using this garlic press more than any other press I've owned, mainly because it's very easy to clean. As a fairly lazy person, I find that appealing. You just flip out the section that collects the garlic detritus and scrape said detritus into the trash. I usually then put it into the dishwasher on its side with the various parts extended for a more thorough cleaning.<br /><br />Being lazy, I also appreciate that the Kuhn Rikon press makes efficient use of my admittedly limp application of pressure, pushing right through even large cloves. As for the mince produced, I can't say I've inspected it closely for evenness (that would require extra care and effort).<br /><br />Lastly, it seems to be quite durable and has no scratchable nonstick finish or other ill-conceived ""feature.""<br /><br />As my mother pointed out, I probably could just mince my garlic the old-fashioned way, with a chef's knife, but why?

The Kuhn Rikon was at the top of the list! I figured if I was going to destroy a perfectly good clove of garlic (according to auntie) I should do it in style. At $40 it is a pretty tool, feels good in the hand, is easy to clean and if you peel the cloves,you can run quite a few pieces through the press without cleaning in between squeezes.

1216,"Best garlic press I've owned. Not only does it do an amazing job at pressing garlic, it's extremely easy to clean. Most garlic presses are such a pain to clean, they're almost not worth using. It also presses large cloves of garlic. I used to have to cut the clove in half first. Would definitely recomend this press.",5.0

1231,"I requested this press for my birthday on the strength of the Cooks Illustrated review.  It came (from Amazon) the other day, and it looks great.<br /><br />HOWEVER, when it came time to use it for the first time, I put in one clove, started to crush, and the press just broke in my hand!  The short pin that forms one side of the top handle hinge broke away from the body.  No garlic even made it through the seive!<br /><br />Since everyone seems to love this press, I'm willing to chalk it up to bad luck and give it another try.  I'll be calling the company today to see about getting it replaced, and will update my review accordingly.<br /><br />UPDATE (2011):  I called the company, explained what had happened, and a few weeks later received a replacement.  We've been using it ever since (three years now) with no issues.  It works fine.  Easy enough to squeeze, easy enough to clean.  Nothing revolutionary.",4.0

I'm upgrading from an annoying, inefficient one and look forward to using this one. Their rating: Three stars for consistency of garlic (so larger pieces don't drop to the bottom of recipes/smaller pieces don't scorch) pressing performance, design, and cleanup.",5.0
