0,Solid to the grip.  Well made.  Love the way the nubs line up with the holes to force the garlic through. Stainless A+,5.0
1,"The garlic press arrived with a slightly different color tone. It is more closely to the color of the stainless steel that the press is made of, and feels solid when hold in hand. The teeth and the base match with each other quite well, so most of the garlic comes out when press hardly. The residual left inside also comes out easily when I release the arm, so I don’t waste any of the garlic. I also like how easy it is to clean the garlic press. Just press couple of times under running water and voila it is as clean as it was never used. I tried the garlic with peel but the peel stopped the garlic from coming out. It is not a big deal to me though. Overall I am satisfied with the quality of this garlic press and recommend it.",5.0
2,"I've had this garlic press for 8 months now and use it regularly. Works just as well as when I first purchased it. I've had several garlic presses before and eventually the hinge would break or the press-part (sorry don't know what it's called) would not line up as well or would break. This is my first fully stainless steel press and it's been GREAT. Definitely worth the little extra cash. Also, I chose this one because it doesn't have the removable basket that some presses have, but I find really annoying. This is super easy to clean too. I highly recommend.",5.0
3,"Absolutely love it, this garlic presser is not the cheap garbage you could accidentally get from online shopping. It's well casted in stainless steel and still looks shiny and brandnew after I throw it into a dish wash machine, the handle fits well, the garlic comes out well minced. A very good choice for anyone who likes adding garlic flavor to their food while keeps hands clean. 5 stars recommended!",5.0
4,"I used another garlic press before, but it was not really . This one is the perfect one of excellent quality and was exactly what I was looking for.

This garlic press is also easy to clean.",5.0
5,"Best of the best! Heavy material with coasted for function. Very fine design! Smooth holes and puncturers make it easy to press and clean. I use 1 press for bigger size. The paste is just right 2 more presses. It's easy grabbing, decent weight on hand. Mostly important one hand can handle it. I don't feel any extra pressure needed compare to other brands.",5.0
6,"The garlic press arrived quickly. The entire press is made of stainless steel and the handles felt smooth and comfortable to the grip.I tried the press on both peeled and unpeeled garlic cloves and it worked perfectly. The entire garlic clove was pressed through and for the unpeeled garlic clove, only the skin was left behind in the presser. With this garlic press, I never have to chop or mince garlic again. I would definitely recommend this product.",5.0
7,Really good garlic press. It is sturdy and not too heavy which I really liked. I was impressed with the additional tool this garlic press brought. First time seeing silicone peeler. Took me a bit to use peeler properly but after mastering it is the best tool ever. It is nicely compacted and does not take much space in kitchen drawer,5.0
8,"After trying this garlic press out, I put it in my kitchen drawers and sent the &#34;good&#34; one out to the motorhome. I like this one much better! It is big enough so that I don't have to chop up garlic cloves to make them fit, and the press pushes the garlic straight through the press - no more poking and scraping to get pieces of garlic out of the holes when I clean it.",5.0
9,"This garlic press is so good, and it has changed the way I cook,  I love fresh garlic in my cooking, and I used to spend a lot of time chopping it up on a cutting board, accepting the fact that my hands would always have the lingering scent of garlic. Now that I have this garlic press, it has reduced my chopping time in half. It's so easy to use, no hassle to clean, and now I get to enjoy even more garlic in all my favorite recipes. Highly recommend.",5.0

15,"its a very solid garlic press, made of metal. It is way better than other garlic press I purchased recently.

20,"I have gone through many crushers and my main complain about them is that they hurt my hand, they require a lot of force to crush the cloves, they are made of cheap materials and they break.

The Kebley, however, seems to have the perfect physics to make the job easier, and once again I am totally enjoying fresh-pressed garlic daily.  I do peel the cloves of garlic before pressing by using a silicone tube-type peeler, one of the simplest, effective gadgets I have ever used, also friendly for arthritic fingers.  For clean up I recommend rinsing the press immediately after using and gently removing anything stuck in it with the point of a paring knife.",5.0

431,"Kitchen experience: intermediate level slow cooker chef.<br /><br />Tl;dr:<br />I instantly hated this garlic press. I then discovered that I don't have to peel the garlic cloves before pressing them. Now I love it.<br /><br />I am always on the lookout for new cooking methods/utilizations or recipes that will minimize my time in the kitchen while maximizing my food's flavor. I came across a slow cooker recipe that called for 10 minutes of food prep, but I found myself spending 15 minutes on the garlic: peeling the garlic, cutting off the garlic ends, peeling the garlic, AGAIN.. mincing the garlic, muttering to myself how much I suck at using a chef's knife, getting my fingers sticky and reeking of garlic...<br /><br />I came across the Kebley g-press on Amazon due to high reviews, and it has become a game changer for me in the kitchen ever since I bought it and actually learned how to use it correctly.<br /><br />First impressions:<br /><br />Looks: it may or may not be the most aerodynamic garlic press on the market, but the speed at which you actually press the garlic is entirely dependent on the individual user. The plastic inserts on the insides of the handles are a bit tacky, but I reassure myself every time I use it that my friends don't think any less of me for not owning a 100% stainless steel garlic press.<br /><br />Weight: solid tool with a nice heft to it, which could easily double this g-press as a blunt object for self-defense, if necessary.<br /><br />Size: it fits comfortably in my hand (I can palm a basketball).<br /><br />Feel: the actual &#34;pressing&#34; motion has a nice firm give towards the end of the final &#34;make sure it's all out of there&#34; squeeze, but not so much that I ever feel like I am going to snap the thing in half. I would speculate that it has the potential to last me my entire lifetime.<br /><br />Conclusion: as I mentioned before - I was an idiot and had no clue that you can just toss in a clove and squeeze the garlic right out the press. I was still wheeling and peeling the stuff before putting it through the press, and because of that, the garlic would ooze out the top like when you use too much play-dough in a play-dough mold. It was incredibly frustrating having that happen and then delicately opening the press to avoid 1/3 of the semi-smushed garlic from plopping out and onto my countertop. I would then have to realign the leftover 1/3 semi-smushed garlic back into the press, only to witness the same thing happen, again. Don't be like me.<br /><br />Cleanup was much, much easier once I figured out that you can keep the peel on the clove when pressing it.<br /><br />I am all about efficiency, which is why I gave this garlic press 4 stars. In a perfect world, Kebley would have included an additional silicon or plastic piece/tool (even something as simple as a plastic toothpick) to aid in poking the garlic mash out of the holes for an easier cleanup. Aside from that, I would highly recommend this product to anyone who hates chopping garlic with a knife.",4.0

The material is hard and heavy and it did a great job when press the garlic. It's easy to clean too. You just need to wash it under a running water! Very good product!,5.0
484,"What kind of sorcery is this?!<br />The only thing I don't love is that you do have to pick out the peel from the tool. It won't usually just rinse out, which does leave a little bit of a garlic smell on your fingers, but I used a fork to do it the last couple of times and it's perfect!<br />PERFECT minced garlic. Extra large cloves aren't going to fit, but you can push it down a little to make room, and then push it down the rest of the way once some of it is minced.<br />My guacamole is so much easier to make now! :)",4.0
